    abstract = { AbstractCritical race theory (CRT) is rarely discussed in LIS literature. Two principles of CRT, interest convergence and differential racialization, can possibly help us to better understand and challenge the pervasiveness and harmfulness of Whiteness in LIS. The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate how crippling Whiteness can be to Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) library employees. Survey feedback provided insight into how BIPOC employees feel about their positions within academic libraries and LIS. Themes from the film Get Out were explored in this survey to examine if the library is the proverbial Sunken Place. }

Seventy-six participants shared their fiction search and reading experiences through an open-ended, free-writing-style online survey. Findings show that readers’ motivations (a sense of connection, comfort and safety, diverse selection, escapism, coping with stressful circumstances) and corresponding fiction elements (e.g., author’s background information, themes, mood) were closely related to the situations or contexts that readers experienced, especially so for stress stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. }

In this article, we study the case of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to identify the potential role of public libraries in a quadruple helix model of smart city development. Our findings indicate that the Chattanooga Public Library is mainly contributing to building a smart Chattanooga in three different ways: (a) by developing smart citizens, (b) by enabling citizen participation, and (c) by providing an innovation environment. Thus, it is part of the fourth helix, but it is also becoming an important space for the collaboration and interaction of actors in all four helixes. }

Using a collective case study methodology based on interviews with library staff, the findings describe three resources that supported the online transition—existing knowledge, technology infrastructure and staff with technology expertise, and interorganizational collaboration—while navigating challenges related to logistics, lack of staff and training, substitution for the benefits of experiential learning, facilitation of online interactions, online marketing and program assessment, and social issues. The findings illustrate how online maker programming has expanded through changes in approaches. This article illustrates an increased level of accessibility, new skills for future maker programming, and changes in perceptions about online learning and making, as three central outcomes. These findings lay the groundwork for future research developing robust design guidelines for online maker programming beyond the pandemic. }

Findings indicate that students lack awareness and understanding of the library’s online resources and would like the library to provide support in ways that could help them enhance productivity and lessen anxiety in the new reality of learning. Libraries should consider making more outreach efforts and offering programs and events to ameliorate isolation and improve students’ sense of community. In this study, we seek to provide academic libraries with a nuanced view of user needs and thus help them make informed decisions to serve their campus communities during the unprecedented health crisis. Through the exploration and documentation of college students’ library use and needs, we also hope to document this critical historical event for the library community. }

The APALA Rubric’s creation was inspired by the Council on Interracial Books for Children’s “Ten Quick Ways to Analyze Children’s Books for Sexism and Racism” (1974). This article discusses the APALA Rubric within an Asian critical theory framework, especially the tenets of Asianization, counterstorytelling, and intersectionality, and guides readers through using it to evaluate youth literature depicting Asian and Pacific Islander diasporas. The APALA Rubric is divided into categories, including stereotypes, tokenism, humanity, power, agency, heroes, and racism. This article analyzes specific examples of youth literature to explain how they affirm or fail to affirm the criteria for those categories. }

Mean and mode calculations were used to rank results. Additionally, LIS faculty were asked to list the five most prestigious journals to be published in for tenure and promotion purposes at their institution. Several journals were rated highly by each method. LIS faculty ratings of LIS journals are useful for assessing journal quality not only for decisions regarding collection management but for tenure and promotion as well. }

The IFLA’s 16 guidelines-based recommendations were presented to representatives of eight schools, and a workshop was organized in response to their feedback. Librarians and principals from 42 schools in Guangzhou assessed the guidelines both before and after the workshop. Most recommendations were considered applicable, but several areas were thought to be poorly suited to the Chinese situation. Many participants’ concerns about the relevance of the recommendations were allayed by the training provided during the workshop. However, the training not only informed the participating school librarians of the areas in which the recommendations were appropriate but also highlighted areas where they were not. In particular, participants felt that some elements of the recommendations were politically insensitive and that the lack of status of school librarians in China would make some of them impractical. }

Despite the tremendous interest surrounding young people and STEM education, the role of school libraries in these initiatives is rarely examined. In this article, we outline a sociocultural approach to explore how school library programs can play a critical role in STEM education and articulate the need for research that examines the contributions of school libraries as potential hybrid spaces for STEM learning. We propose that school library programs become active participants in STEM learning through the specific roles that school librarians currently play in schools, such as information specialist, instructional partner, and technology ally. We also highlight how these roles can be tailored toward helping young people develop STEM identities. }

The turbulent sociopolitical ecosystem, exemplified by the Black Lives Matter movement, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2020 US presidential election, has dominated recent print and electronic media and highlighted the malleable nature of information. Ubiquitous social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others have become the vehicles through which consumers of political information are gaining a practical understanding of the inseparable nature of politics and information. As a major provider and facilitator of access to information, libraries have been drawn into the ideological confrontation between the traditional concepts of information, truth, and access. This article presents an interdisciplinary mapping of the intersections of politics and information and establishes a foundation for understanding ways in which that convergence affects the roles, engagement, and responsibilities of libraries. }

The analytical framework for the study consists of a reconstructed version of the catalog and its historical contexts. In analyzing the surviving text of the catalog, the study identifies its bibliographic objectives as the identification, choice, finding, and collocating objectives. Further deduced from these objectives, the study reasons out four general purposes that might be intended by the catalog’s compiler Liu Xin: the catalog was to be a guide to literature, a plan for knowledge organization, a retrieval tool, and a library inventory. Ru classicism (or Confucianism) was the catalog’s guiding philosophy. In classicism‐dominated imperial China, generations of bibliographers followed this model and focused their attention primarily on making bibliography both a classicist guide to literature and a plan for organizing knowledge. }

In information science, critical librarianship seeks to disrupt normative approaches to library work by confronting these ideologies and systems, empowering both library workers and users to understand how these structures affect access and dissemination of information. In industrial design, critical design challenges the status quo by posing troublesome design problems that encourage reflection and discourse. Design works that fall under this category are reactions against consumerism, systemic biases, and heedless scientific and technological development. In librarianship, critical design may be employed to help us explore current paradigms and approaches to library spaces, services, and technologies, as well as to uncover assumptions about what a library is and what a librarian does. Prototypes and narratives derived from critical design can make visible the normative constructions and problems heartedly debated in librarianship. }

These administrators are also confident in the success of these programs, despite little formal assessment of outcomes for learners. Success is measured by numbers of program participants and anecdotal evidence of positive outcomes for learners, such as increased confidence or an intention to move forward with career goals. This limited approach to measuring the success of digital literacy programs reveals significant opportunity to more fully and systematically evaluate the outcomes of these programs and to assess whether program goals are being met and ongoing investment of resources is merited. }

Eight librarians/library staff representing three participating sites were interviewed at the beginning and the end of the project. We discuss various opportunities and difficulties that emerged in this project to better understand the role and perspective of librarians and then examine implications for those who are considering implementing similar youth programs at their institutions.

In fact, founding critical race theorists Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic wrote about law libraries and legal information—just as several law librarians and legal information scholars were writing about critical legal theory—in the earliest days of the movement. This paper surveys these works and assesses the impact they have had on law librarianship in the hope of encouraging CRT-aligned LIS scholars and librarians in other subfields to discover this previously overlooked foundation of CRT in LIS. }
