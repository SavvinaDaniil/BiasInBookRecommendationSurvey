Get Out: Academic Libraries as the Sunken Place,https://doi.org/10.1086/731844,['Simone Williams'],"AbstractCritical race theory (CRT) is rarely discussed in LIS literature. Two principles of CRT, interest convergence and differential racialization, can possibly help us to better understand and challenge the pervasiveness and harmfulness of Whiteness in LIS. The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate how crippling Whiteness can be to Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) library employees. Survey feedback provided insight into how BIPOC employees feel about their positions within academic libraries and LIS. Themes from the film Get Out were explored in this survey to examine if the library is the proverbial Sunken Place.",The Library Quarterly,2024
Reading When Stressed: Understanding Motivations for Reading Fiction and Enhancing Future Recommendation Services,https://doi.org/10.1086/730461,"['Hyerim Cho', 'Wan-Chen Lee', 'Li-Min Huang', 'Alex Urban']","AbstractThis study investigated fiction readers’ motivations for reading, their relevant needs regarding the fiction attributes, and their expectations for future fiction recommendation services. Seventy-six participants shared their fiction search and reading experiences through an open-ended, free-writing-style online survey. Findings show that readers’ motivations (a sense of connection, comfort and safety, diverse selection, escapism, coping with stressful circumstances) and corresponding fiction elements (e.g., author’s background information, themes, mood) were closely related to the situations or contexts that readers experienced, especially so for stress stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.",The Library Quarterly,2024
"The Potential Role of Public Libraries in a Quadruple Helix Model of “Smart City” Development: Lessons from Chattanooga, Tennessee",https://doi.org/10.1086/721399,"['Mila Gasco-Hernandez', 'Xiaoyi Yerden', 'G. Burke', 'J. Gil-Garcia']","AbstractAlthough previous studies on “smart cities” have acknowledged the participation of different actors in their development, there is limited research exploring the involvement of community-rooted organizations, such as public libraries, in specific smart city models and frameworks. In this article, we study the case of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to identify the potential role of public libraries in a quadruple helix model of smart city development. Our findings indicate that the Chattanooga Public Library is mainly contributing to building a smart Chattanooga in three different ways: (a) by developing smart citizens, (b) by enabling citizen participation, and (c) by providing an innovation environment. Thus, it is part of the fourth helix, but it is also becoming an important space for the collaboration and interaction of actors in all four helixes.",The Library Quarterly,2022
Transition of Public and Academic Library Makerspaces from Physical to Online Settings during a Pandemic,https://doi.org/10.1086/723848,"['Soo Kim', 'Yong Jung', 'Gi Choi']","AbstractThis research investigates how academic and public library makerspaces transitioned to online maker programming during COVID-19. Using a collective case study methodology based on interviews with library staff, the findings describe three resources that supported the online transition—existing knowledge, technology infrastructure and staff with technology expertise, and interorganizational collaboration—while navigating challenges related to logistics, lack of staff and training, substitution for the benefits of experiential learning, facilitation of online interactions, online marketing and program assessment, and social issues. The findings illustrate how online maker programming has expanded through changes in approaches. This article illustrates an increased level of accessibility, new skills for future maker programming, and changes in perceptions about online learning and making, as three central outcomes. These findings lay the groundwork for future research developing robust design guidelines for online maker programming beyond the pandemic.",The Library Quarterly,2023
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Chinese College Students’ Information Behavior and Library Needs: A Qualitative Study,https://doi.org/10.1086/713051,"['Yanxia Shi', 'Chundong Li', 'Lili Luo']","AbstractUsing journaling and in-depth interviews, a qualitative study was conducted to examine the library use and library needs of Chinese college students during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Findings indicate that students lack awareness and understanding of the library’s online resources and would like the library to provide support in ways that could help them enhance productivity and lessen anxiety in the new reality of learning. Libraries should consider making more outreach efforts and offering programs and events to ameliorate isolation and improve students’ sense of community. In this study, we seek to provide academic libraries with a nuanced view of user needs and thus help them make informed decisions to serve their campus communities during the unprecedented health crisis. Through the exploration and documentation of college students’ library use and needs, we also hope to document this critical historical event for the library community.",The Library Quarterly,2021

An Application of Asian Critical Theory to Books for Young Readers: The APALA Rubric to Evaluate Asian American and Pacific Islander Youth Literature,https://doi.org/10.1086/731840,"['Amy Breslin', 'Sarah Dahlen', 'Kristen Kwisnek', 'Becky Leathersich']","AbstractA subcommittee under the Family Literacy Focus committee of the Asian Pacific American Librarians Association (APALA) created a comprehensive rubric for evaluating Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) representation in youth literature. The APALA Rubric’s creation was inspired by the Council on Interracial Books for Children’s “Ten Quick Ways to Analyze Children’s Books for Sexism and Racism” (1974). This article discusses the APALA Rubric within an Asian critical theory framework, especially the tenets of Asianization, counterstorytelling, and intersectionality, and guides readers through using it to evaluate youth literature depicting Asian and Pacific Islander diasporas. The APALA Rubric is divided into categories, including stereotypes, tokenism, humanity, power, agency, heroes, and racism. This article analyzes specific examples of youth literature to explain how they affirm or fail to affirm the criteria for those categories.",The Library Quarterly,2024
Library and Information Science Journal Prestige as Assessed by Library and Information Science Faculty,https://doi.org/10.1086/668574,['Laura Manzari'],"AbstractThis prestige study surveyed full-time faculty of American Library Association (ALA)–accredited programs in library and information studies regarding library and information science (LIS) journals. Faculty were asked to rate a list of eighty-nine LIS journals on a scale from 1 to 5 based on each journal’s importance to their research and teaching. Mean and mode calculations were used to rank results. Additionally, LIS faculty were asked to list the five most prestigious journals to be published in for tenure and promotion purposes at their institution. Several journals were rated highly by each method. LIS faculty ratings of LIS journals are useful for assessing journal quality not only for decisions regarding collection management but for tenure and promotion as well.",The Library Quarterly,2013
On the Applicability of IFLA Standards in Different Local Contexts: The Case of IFLA School Library Guidelines in China,https://doi.org/10.1086/703470,"['Jing Zhang', 'Lin Lin', 'A. Madden', 'Ying Zhang']","AbstractThis article reports responses to the IFLA’s school library guidelines by school librarians in South China. The IFLA’s 16 guidelines-based recommendations were presented to representatives of eight schools, and a workshop was organized in response to their feedback. Librarians and principals from 42 schools in Guangzhou assessed the guidelines both before and after the workshop. Most recommendations were considered applicable, but several areas were thought to be poorly suited to the Chinese situation. Many participants’ concerns about the relevance of the recommendations were allayed by the training provided during the workshop. However, the training not only informed the participating school librarians of the areas in which the recommendations were appropriate but also highlighted areas where they were not. In particular, participants felt that some elements of the recommendations were politically insensitive and that the lack of status of school librarians in China would make some of them impractical.",The Library Quarterly,2019
Reimagining the Role of School Libraries in STEM Education: Creating Hybrid Spaces for Exploration,https://doi.org/10.1086/664578,"['Mega Subramaniam', 'June Ahn', 'Kenneth Fleischmann', 'Allison Druin']","In recent years, many technological interventions have surfaced, such as virtual worlds, games, and digital labs, that aspire to link young people’s interest in media technology and social networks to learning about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) areas. Despite the tremendous interest surrounding young people and STEM education, the role of school libraries in these initiatives is rarely examined. In this article, we outline a sociocultural approach to explore how school library programs can play a critical role in STEM education and articulate the need for research that examines the contributions of school libraries as potential hybrid spaces for STEM learning. We propose that school library programs become active participants in STEM learning through the specific roles that school librarians currently play in schools, such as information specialist, instructional partner, and technology ally. We also highlight how these roles can be tailored toward helping young people develop STEM identities.",The Library Quarterly,2012

By drawing on the resources of the community, the library staff facilitated connections between writers and their readers with literary gatherings; between artists and their viewers with art exhibitions; and between playwrights, performers, and their audiences with theatrical productions. But the library's most significant legacy was its book collection, now known as the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, which has provided a permanent connection between a people and their history.",The Library Quarterly,2003
Mapping Intersections of Politics and Information in Twenty-First-Century Cyberculture,https://doi.org/10.1086/717231,"['Maurice Wheeler', 'Samuel Muwanguzi']","AbstractCurrent observation of social media suggests the fusion of politics and information is possibly more pronounced in recent history than ever before. The turbulent sociopolitical ecosystem, exemplified by the Black Lives Matter movement, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2020 US presidential election, has dominated recent print and electronic media and highlighted the malleable nature of information. Ubiquitous social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others have become the vehicles through which consumers of political information are gaining a practical understanding of the inseparable nature of politics and information. As a major provider and facilitator of access to information, libraries have been drawn into the ideological confrontation between the traditional concepts of information, truth, and access. This article presents an interdisciplinary mapping of the intersections of politics and information and establishes a foundation for understanding ways in which that convergence affects the roles, engagement, and responsibilities of libraries.",The Library Quarterly,2022

Purposes and Bibliographic Objectives of a Pioneer Library Catalog in China,https://doi.org/10.1086/597081,"['Hur‐Li Lee', 'Wen‐Chin Lan']","This research aims to ascertain the conceptual basics underlying the design of the Seven Epitomes, the first library catalog to establish the bibliographic model in imperial China. The analytical framework for the study consists of a reconstructed version of the catalog and its historical contexts. In analyzing the surviving text of the catalog, the study identifies its bibliographic objectives as the identification, choice, finding, and collocating objectives. Further deduced from these objectives, the study reasons out four general purposes that might be intended by the catalog’s compiler Liu Xin: the catalog was to be a guide to literature, a plan for knowledge organization, a retrieval tool, and a library inventory. Ru classicism (or Confucianism) was the catalog’s guiding philosophy. In classicism‐dominated imperial China, generations of bibliographers followed this model and focused their attention primarily on making bibliography both a classicist guide to literature and a plan for organizing knowledge.",The Library Quarterly,2009
Critical Design in Librarianship: Visual and Narrative Exploration for Critical Praxis,https://doi.org/10.1086/704965,['Shannon Robinson'],"AbstractIn a politically charged social climate, many disciplines are inwardly grappling with historic ideologies and systems of oppression. In information science, critical librarianship seeks to disrupt normative approaches to library work by confronting these ideologies and systems, empowering both library workers and users to understand how these structures affect access and dissemination of information. In industrial design, critical design challenges the status quo by posing troublesome design problems that encourage reflection and discourse. Design works that fall under this category are reactions against consumerism, systemic biases, and heedless scientific and technological development. In librarianship, critical design may be employed to help us explore current paradigms and approaches to library spaces, services, and technologies, as well as to uncover assumptions about what a library is and what a librarian does. Prototypes and narratives derived from critical design can make visible the normative constructions and problems heartedly debated in librarianship.",The Library Quarterly,2019
"Digital Literacy Training in Canada, Part 2: Defining and Measuring Success",https://doi.org/10.1086/717233,"['Heidi Julien', 'David Gerstle', 'Brian Detlor', 'Tara Rose', 'Alexander Serenko']","AbstractThis study explores how public libraries and other local community organizations can best deliver and evaluate the digital literacy initiatives they provide to the communities they serve; this article focuses on program evaluation. Interviews with 14 administrators of digital literacy programs revealed that administrators espouse idealistic intentions for digital literacy programs, particularly to give marginalized people increased educational and vocational opportunities. These administrators are also confident in the success of these programs, despite little formal assessment of outcomes for learners. Success is measured by numbers of program participants and anecdotal evidence of positive outcomes for learners, such as increased confidence or an intention to move forward with career goals. This limited approach to measuring the success of digital literacy programs reveals significant opportunity to more fully and systematically evaluate the outcomes of these programs and to assess whether program goals are being met and ongoing investment of resources is merited.",The Library Quarterly,2022

Programs narrowly defined digital literacy as skillful use of a range of basic and more advanced technologies. Funding from corporate or other external sources and community interest are key to establishing programs. Challenges arise from lack of resources, including staff time, and limited staff expertise, as well as competition for learners’ time.",The Library Quarterly,2021
Supporting Youth Mental Health through Co-designing a Virtual Reality Experience: A Recipe-Based Co-design Model,https://doi.org/10.1086/729230,"['Jin Lee', 'Elin Bj\\""{o}rling', 'Ryan McLean', 'Anna Moreno', 'Kung Lee']","AbstractThere is a need for librarians to find ways to provide service to the youth population regarding mental health. Building on prior research about co-design and virtual reality in public libraries, the research team aimed to create a positive teen mental health experience by co-designing a virtual reality space through the library system. Eight librarians/library staff representing three participating sites were interviewed at the beginning and the end of the project. We discuss various opportunities and difficulties that emerged in this project to better understand the role and perspective of librarians and then examine implications for those who are considering implementing similar youth programs at their institutions. On the basis of the findings, we propose a recipe-based co-design model to better support librarians by allowing flexibility while clarifying which core elements need to be preserved in the co-design process.",The Library Quarterly,2024
"First Contact: Law Librarianship, the Triple Helix Dilemma, and the Overlooked Foundation of CRT in LIS",https://doi.org/10.1086/731837,"['Nicholas Mignanelli', 'Grace Lo']","AbstractIn the last two decades, librarians and LIS scholars have turned to critical race theory (CRT) for new insights about their field and its relationship to race and racism in the United States. Yet law librarians have been engaging CRT since the 1980s. In fact, founding critical race theorists Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic wrote about law libraries and legal information—just as several law librarians and legal information scholars were writing about critical legal theory—in the earliest days of the movement. This paper surveys these works and assesses the impact they have had on law librarianship in the hope of encouraging CRT-aligned LIS scholars and librarians in other subfields to discover this previously overlooked foundation of CRT in LIS.",The Library Quarterly,2024
