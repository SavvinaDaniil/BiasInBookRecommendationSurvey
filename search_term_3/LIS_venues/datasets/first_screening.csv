Get Out: Academic Libraries as the Sunken Place,Not about RS or AI,"The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate how crippling Whiteness can be to Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) library employees. Survey feedback provided insight into how BIPOC employees feel about their positions within academic libraries and LIS.",https://doi.org/10.1086/731844,['Simone Williams'],"AbstractCritical race theory (CRT) is rarely discussed in LIS literature. Two principles of CRT, interest convergence and differential racialization, can possibly help us to better understand and challenge the pervasiveness and harmfulness of Whiteness in LIS. The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate how crippling Whiteness can be to Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) library employees. Survey feedback provided insight into how BIPOC employees feel about their positions within academic libraries and LIS. Themes from the film Get Out were explored in this survey to examine if the library is the proverbial Sunken Place.",The Library Quarterly,2024
Reading When Stressed: Understanding Motivations for Reading Fiction and Enhancing Future Recommendation Services,Yes,"This study investigated fiction readers’ motivations for reading, their relevant needs regarding the fiction attributes, and their expectations for future fiction recommendation services.",https://doi.org/10.1086/730461,"['Hyerim Cho', 'Wan-Chen Lee', 'Li-Min Huang', 'Alex Urban']","AbstractThis study investigated fiction readers’ motivations for reading, their relevant needs regarding the fiction attributes, and their expectations for future fiction recommendation services. Seventy-six participants shared their fiction search and reading experiences through an open-ended, free-writing-style online survey. Findings show that readers’ motivations (a sense of connection, comfort and safety, diverse selection, escapism, coping with stressful circumstances) and corresponding fiction elements (e.g., author’s background information, themes, mood) were closely related to the situations or contexts that readers experienced, especially so for stress stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.",The Library Quarterly,2024
"The Potential Role of Public Libraries in a Quadruple Helix Model of “Smart City” Development: Lessons from Chattanooga, Tennessee",Not about diversity in that way,,https://doi.org/10.1086/721399,"['Mila Gasco-Hernandez', 'Xiaoyi Yerden', 'G. Burke', 'J. Gil-Garcia']","AbstractAlthough previous studies on “smart cities” have acknowledged the participation of different actors in their development, there is limited research exploring the involvement of community-rooted organizations, such as public libraries, in specific smart city models and frameworks. In this article, we study the case of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to identify the potential role of public libraries in a quadruple helix model of smart city development. Our findings indicate that the Chattanooga Public Library is mainly contributing to building a smart Chattanooga in three different ways: (a) by developing smart citizens, (b) by enabling citizen participation, and (c) by providing an innovation environment. Thus, it is part of the fourth helix, but it is also becoming an important space for the collaboration and interaction of actors in all four helixes.",The Library Quarterly,2022
Transition of Public and Academic Library Makerspaces from Physical to Online Settings during a Pandemic,Not about AI or RS,"This research investigates how academic and public library makerspaces transitioned to online
maker programming during COVID-19.",https://doi.org/10.1086/723848,"['Soo Kim', 'Yong Jung', 'Gi Choi']","AbstractThis research investigates how academic and public library makerspaces transitioned to online maker programming during COVID-19. Using a collective case study methodology based on interviews with library staff, the findings describe three resources that supported the online transition—existing knowledge, technology infrastructure and staff with technology expertise, and interorganizational collaboration—while navigating challenges related to logistics, lack of staff and training, substitution for the benefits of experiential learning, facilitation of online interactions, online marketing and program assessment, and social issues. The findings illustrate how online maker programming has expanded through changes in approaches. This article illustrates an increased level of accessibility, new skills for future maker programming, and changes in perceptions about online learning and making, as three central outcomes. These findings lay the groundwork for future research developing robust design guidelines for online maker programming beyond the pandemic.",The Library Quarterly,2023
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Chinese College Students’ Information Behavior and Library Needs: A Qualitative Study,Not about bias/diversity in RS,"Using journaling and in-depth interviews, a qualitative study was conducted to examine the library use and library needs of Chinese college students during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic",https://doi.org/10.1086/713051,"['Yanxia Shi', 'Chundong Li', 'Lili Luo']","AbstractUsing journaling and in-depth interviews, a qualitative study was conducted to examine the library use and library needs of Chinese college students during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Findings indicate that students lack awareness and understanding of the library’s online resources and would like the library to provide support in ways that could help them enhance productivity and lessen anxiety in the new reality of learning. Libraries should consider making more outreach efforts and offering programs and events to ameliorate isolation and improve students’ sense of community. In this study, we seek to provide academic libraries with a nuanced view of user needs and thus help them make informed decisions to serve their campus communities during the unprecedented health crisis. Through the exploration and documentation of college students’ library use and needs, we also hope to document this critical historical event for the library community.",The Library Quarterly,2021

An Application of Asian Critical Theory to Books for Young Readers: The APALA Rubric to Evaluate Asian American and Pacific Islander Youth Literature,Not about RS or AI,A subcommittee under the Family Literacy Focus committee of the Asian Pacific American Librarians Association (APALA) created a comprehensive rubric for evaluating Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) representation in youth literature.,https://doi.org/10.1086/731840,"['Amy Breslin', 'Sarah Dahlen', 'Kristen Kwisnek', 'Becky Leathersich']","AbstractA subcommittee under the Family Literacy Focus committee of the Asian Pacific American Librarians Association (APALA) created a comprehensive rubric for evaluating Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) representation in youth literature. The APALA Rubric’s creation was inspired by the Council on Interracial Books for Children’s “Ten Quick Ways to Analyze Children’s Books for Sexism and Racism” (1974). This article discusses the APALA Rubric within an Asian critical theory framework, especially the tenets of Asianization, counterstorytelling, and intersectionality, and guides readers through using it to evaluate youth literature depicting Asian and Pacific Islander diasporas. The APALA Rubric is divided into categories, including stereotypes, tokenism, humanity, power, agency, heroes, and racism. This article analyzes specific examples of youth literature to explain how they affirm or fail to affirm the criteria for those categories.",The Library Quarterly,2024
Library and Information Science Journal Prestige as Assessed by Library and Information Science Faculty,Irrelevant,,https://doi.org/10.1086/668574,['Laura Manzari'],"AbstractThis prestige study surveyed full-time faculty of American Library Association (ALA)–accredited programs in library and information studies regarding library and information science (LIS) journals. Faculty were asked to rate a list of eighty-nine LIS journals on a scale from 1 to 5 based on each journal’s importance to their research and teaching. Mean and mode calculations were used to rank results. Additionally, LIS faculty were asked to list the five most prestigious journals to be published in for tenure and promotion purposes at their institution. Several journals were rated highly by each method. LIS faculty ratings of LIS journals are useful for assessing journal quality not only for decisions regarding collection management but for tenure and promotion as well.",The Library Quarterly,2013
On the Applicability of IFLA Standards in Different Local Contexts: The Case of IFLA School Library Guidelines in China,Irrelevant,"This article reports responses to the IFLA’s school library guidelines by school librarians in South
China",https://doi.org/10.1086/703470,"['Jing Zhang', 'Lin Lin', 'A. Madden', 'Ying Zhang']","AbstractThis article reports responses to the IFLA’s school library guidelines by school librarians in South China. The IFLA’s 16 guidelines-based recommendations were presented to representatives of eight schools, and a workshop was organized in response to their feedback. Librarians and principals from 42 schools in Guangzhou assessed the guidelines both before and after the workshop. Most recommendations were considered applicable, but several areas were thought to be poorly suited to the Chinese situation. Many participants’ concerns about the relevance of the recommendations were allayed by the training provided during the workshop. However, the training not only informed the participating school librarians of the areas in which the recommendations were appropriate but also highlighted areas where they were not. In particular, participants felt that some elements of the recommendations were politically insensitive and that the lack of status of school librarians in China would make some of them impractical.",The Library Quarterly,2019
Reimagining the Role of School Libraries in STEM Education: Creating Hybrid Spaces for Exploration,Not about AI or RS,,https://doi.org/10.1086/664578,"['Mega Subramaniam', 'June Ahn', 'Kenneth Fleischmann', 'Allison Druin']","In recent years, many technological interventions have surfaced, such as virtual worlds, games, and digital labs, that aspire to link young people’s interest in media technology and social networks to learning about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) areas. Despite the tremendous interest surrounding young people and STEM education, the role of school libraries in these initiatives is rarely examined. In this article, we outline a sociocultural approach to explore how school library programs can play a critical role in STEM education and articulate the need for research that examines the contributions of school libraries as potential hybrid spaces for STEM learning. We propose that school library programs become active participants in STEM learning through the specific roles that school librarians currently play in schools, such as information specialist, instructional partner, and technology ally. We also highlight how these roles can be tailored toward helping young people develop STEM identities.",The Library Quarterly,2012
"""The Place to Go"": The 135th Street Branch Library and the Harlem Renaissance",Not about AI or RS,,https://doi.org/10.1086/603439,missing,"In the early 1920s, the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library, under the leadership of Ernestine Rose, played a significant role in the Harlem Renaissance movement. By drawing on the resources of the community, the library staff facilitated connections between writers and their readers with literary gatherings; between artists and their viewers with art exhibitions; and between playwrights, performers, and their audiences with theatrical productions. But the library's most significant legacy was its book collection, now known as the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, which has provided a permanent connection between a people and their history.",The Library Quarterly,2003
Mapping Intersections of Politics and Information in Twenty-First-Century Cyberculture,Keep,,https://doi.org/10.1086/717231,"['Maurice Wheeler', 'Samuel Muwanguzi']","AbstractCurrent observation of social media suggests the fusion of politics and information is possibly more pronounced in recent history than ever before. The turbulent sociopolitical ecosystem, exemplified by the Black Lives Matter movement, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2020 US presidential election, has dominated recent print and electronic media and highlighted the malleable nature of information. Ubiquitous social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others have become the vehicles through which consumers of political information are gaining a practical understanding of the inseparable nature of politics and information. As a major provider and facilitator of access to information, libraries have been drawn into the ideological confrontation between the traditional concepts of information, truth, and access. This article presents an interdisciplinary mapping of the intersections of politics and information and establishes a foundation for understanding ways in which that convergence affects the roles, engagement, and responsibilities of libraries.",The Library Quarterly,2022

Purposes and Bibliographic Objectives of a Pioneer Library Catalog in China,Emperor AI LOL,,https://doi.org/10.1086/597081,"['Hur‐Li Lee', 'Wen‐Chin Lan']","This research aims to ascertain the conceptual basics underlying the design of the Seven Epitomes, the first library catalog to establish the bibliographic model in imperial China. The analytical framework for the study consists of a reconstructed version of the catalog and its historical contexts. In analyzing the surviving text of the catalog, the study identifies its bibliographic objectives as the identification, choice, finding, and collocating objectives. Further deduced from these objectives, the study reasons out four general purposes that might be intended by the catalog’s compiler Liu Xin: the catalog was to be a guide to literature, a plan for knowledge organization, a retrieval tool, and a library inventory. Ru classicism (or Confucianism) was the catalog’s guiding philosophy. In classicism‐dominated imperial China, generations of bibliographers followed this model and focused their attention primarily on making bibliography both a classicist guide to literature and a plan for organizing knowledge.",The Library Quarterly,2009
Critical Design in Librarianship: Visual and Narrative Exploration for Critical Praxis,Keep,,https://doi.org/10.1086/704965,['Shannon Robinson'],"AbstractIn a politically charged social climate, many disciplines are inwardly grappling with historic ideologies and systems of oppression. In information science, critical librarianship seeks to disrupt normative approaches to library work by confronting these ideologies and systems, empowering both library workers and users to understand how these structures affect access and dissemination of information. In industrial design, critical design challenges the status quo by posing troublesome design problems that encourage reflection and discourse. Design works that fall under this category are reactions against consumerism, systemic biases, and heedless scientific and technological development. In librarianship, critical design may be employed to help us explore current paradigms and approaches to library spaces, services, and technologies, as well as to uncover assumptions about what a library is and what a librarian does. Prototypes and narratives derived from critical design can make visible the normative constructions and problems heartedly debated in librarianship.",The Library Quarterly,2019
"Digital Literacy Training in Canada, Part 2: Defining and Measuring Success",Not about RS or AI,This study explores how public libraries and other local community organizations can best deliver and evaluate the digital literacy initiatives they provide to the communities they serve; this article focuses on program evaluation,https://doi.org/10.1086/717233,"['Heidi Julien', 'David Gerstle', 'Brian Detlor', 'Tara Rose', 'Alexander Serenko']","AbstractThis study explores how public libraries and other local community organizations can best deliver and evaluate the digital literacy initiatives they provide to the communities they serve; this article focuses on program evaluation. Interviews with 14 administrators of digital literacy programs revealed that administrators espouse idealistic intentions for digital literacy programs, particularly to give marginalized people increased educational and vocational opportunities. These administrators are also confident in the success of these programs, despite little formal assessment of outcomes for learners. Success is measured by numbers of program participants and anecdotal evidence of positive outcomes for learners, such as increased confidence or an intention to move forward with career goals. This limited approach to measuring the success of digital literacy programs reveals significant opportunity to more fully and systematically evaluate the outcomes of these programs and to assess whether program goals are being met and ongoing investment of resources is merited.",The Library Quarterly,2022

Programs narrowly defined digital literacy as skillful use of a range of basic and more advanced technologies. Funding from corporate or other external sources and community interest are key to establishing programs. Challenges arise from lack of resources, including staff time, and limited staff expertise, as well as competition for learners’ time.",The Library Quarterly,2021
Supporting Youth Mental Health through Co-designing a Virtual Reality Experience: A Recipe-Based Co-design Model,Not about RS or AI,,https://doi.org/10.1086/729230,"['Jin Lee', 'Elin Bj\\""{o}rling', 'Ryan McLean', 'Anna Moreno', 'Kung Lee']","AbstractThere is a need for librarians to find ways to provide service to the youth population regarding mental health. Building on prior research about co-design and virtual reality in public libraries, the research team aimed to create a positive teen mental health experience by co-designing a virtual reality space through the library system. Eight librarians/library staff representing three participating sites were interviewed at the beginning and the end of the project. We discuss various opportunities and difficulties that emerged in this project to better understand the role and perspective of librarians and then examine implications for those who are considering implementing similar youth programs at their institutions. On the basis of the findings, we propose a recipe-based co-design model to better support librarians by allowing flexibility while clarifying which core elements need to be preserved in the co-design process.",The Library Quarterly,2024
"First Contact: Law Librarianship, the Triple Helix Dilemma, and the Overlooked Foundation of CRT in LIS",Not about RS or AI,,https://doi.org/10.1086/731837,"['Nicholas Mignanelli', 'Grace Lo']","AbstractIn the last two decades, librarians and LIS scholars have turned to critical race theory (CRT) for new insights about their field and its relationship to race and racism in the United States. Yet law librarians have been engaging CRT since the 1980s. In fact, founding critical race theorists Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic wrote about law libraries and legal information—just as several law librarians and legal information scholars were writing about critical legal theory—in the earliest days of the movement. This paper surveys these works and assesses the impact they have had on law librarianship in the hope of encouraging CRT-aligned LIS scholars and librarians in other subfields to discover this previously overlooked foundation of CRT in LIS.",The Library Quarterly,2024

Design/methodology/approach Thematic interviews were conducted with 20 Finnish young people aged 15–16 years. The material was analysed using qualitative content analysis, with a focus on everyday information practices involving online platforms. Findings The key finding of the study is that the current affordances of algorithmic recommendations enable users to engage in more passive practices instead of active search and evaluation practices. Two major themes emerged from the analysis: enabling not searching, inviting high trust, which highlights the how the affordances of algorithmic recommendations enable the delegation of search to a recommender system and, at the same time, invite trust in the system, and constraining finding, discouraging diversity, which focuses on the constraining degree of affordances and breakdowns associated with algorithmic recommendations. Originality/value This study contributes new knowledge regarding the ways in which algorithmic recommendations shape the information practices in young people's everyday lives specifically addressing the constraining nature of affordances.",Journal of Documentation,2024
"Labor, classification and productions of culture on Netflix",,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-06-2020-0108,"['Floegel, Diana']","Purpose This paper examines promotional practices Netflix employs via Twitter and its automated recommendation system in order to deepen our understanding of how streaming services contribute to sociotechnical inequities under capitalism. Design/methodology/approach Tweets from two Netflix Twitter accounts as well as material features of Netflix's recommendation system were qualitatively analyzed using inductive analysis and the constant comparative method in order to explore dimensions of Netflix's promotional practices. Findings Twitter accounts and the recommendation system profit off people's labor to promote content, and such labor allows Netflix to create and refine classification practices wherein both people and content are categorized in inequitable ways. Labor and classification feed into Netflix's production of culture via appropriation on Twitter and algorithmic decision-making within both the recommendation system and broader AI-driven production practices. Social implications Assemblages that include algorithmic recommendation systems are imbued with structural inequities and therefore unable to be fixed by merely diversifying cultural industries or retooling algorithms on streaming platforms. It is necessary to understand systemic injustices within these systems so that we may imagine and enact just alternatives. Originality/value Findings demonstrate that via surveillance tactics that exploit people's labor for promotional gains, enforce normative classification schemes, and culminate in normative cultural productions, Netflix engenders practices that regulate bodies and culture in ways that exemplify interconnections between people, machines, and social institutions. These interconnections further reflect and result in material inequities that crystalize within sociotechnical processes.",Journal of Documentation,2021
Evaluating a threefold intervention framework for assisting researchers in literature review and manuscript preparatory tasks,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-06-2016-0072,"['Sesagiri Raamkumar, Aravind', 'Foo, Schubert', 'Pang, Natalie']","Purpose Systems to support literature review (LR) and manuscript preparation tend to focus on only one or two of the tasks involved. The purpose of this paper is to describe an intervention framework that redesigns a particular set of tasks, allowing for interconnectivity between the tasks and providing appropriate user interface display features for each task in a prototype system. Design/methodology/approach A user evaluation study was conducted on the prototype system. The system supports the three tasks: building a reading list (RL) of research papers, finding similar papers based on a set of papers and shortlisting papers from the final RL for inclusion in manuscript based on article type. A total of 119 researchers who had experience in authoring research papers, participated in the evaluation study. They had to select one of the provided 43 topics and execute the tasks offered by the system. Three questionnaires were provided for evaluating the tasks and system. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed on the collected evaluation data. Findings Task redesign aspects had a positive impact in user evaluation for the second task of finding similar papers while improvement was found to be required for the first and third tasks. The tasks interconnectivity features seed basket and RL were helpful for the participants in conveniently searching for papers within the system. Two of the four proposed informational display features, namely, information cue labels and shared co-relations were the most preferred features of the system. Student user group found the task recommendations and the overall system to be more useful and effective than the staff group. Originality/value This study validates the importance of interconnected task design and novel informational display features in accentuating task-based recommendations for LR and manuscript preparatory tasks. The potential for improvement in recommendations was shown through the task redesign exercise where new requirements for the tasks were identified. The resultant prototype system helps in bridging the gap between novices and experts in terms of LR skills.",Journal of Documentation,2017
A sign of a good book: readers’ methods of accessing fiction in the public library,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-04-2012-0041,"['Saarinen, Katariina', 'Vakkari, Pertti']","Purpose  – Lending novels is the major service provided by public libraries. The efforts in developing search systems have been focused on retrieving non-fiction. There is a need for designing systems to support fiction searching in libraries. The aim of this study is to analyze readers’ methods of accessing fiction in a public library for informing the design of fiction search systems. This study seeks to find out which attributes of books readers perceive as indicators of a good novel, and what kind of tactics they use for finding these good novels in the public library.  Design/methodology/approach  – The authors observed 16 adult library users by semi-structured interviews eliciting information about their literary competence, what characterizes a good novel and how they accessed and identified good novels in the library.  Findings  – Based on the data this paper developed a tentative reader typology, which differentiated the attributes of good novels and major tactics for accessing them.  Practical implications  – The typology was used for inferring user models and design ideas for systems supporting fiction searching.  Originality/value  – This is the first empirical study to inform how readers’ literary competence is associated with the tactics used and indicators recognized in books for finding and selecting good novels to borrow.",Journal of Documentation,2013
Tell me how you write and I'll tell you what you read: a study on the writing style of book reviews,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-04-2023-0073,"['Alzetta, Chiara', ""Dell'Orletta, Felice"", 'Miaschi, Alessio', 'Prat, Elena', 'Venturi, Giulia']","Purpose The authors’ goal is to investigate variations in the writing style of book reviews published on different social reading platforms and referring to books of different genres, which enables acquiring insights into communication strategies adopted by readers to share their reading experiences. Design/methodology/approach The authors propose a corpus-based study focused on the analysis of A Good Review, a novel corpus of online book reviews written in Italian, posted on Amazon and Goodreads, and covering six literary fiction genres. The authors rely on stylometric analysis to explore the linguistic properties and lexicon of reviews and the authors conducted automatic classification experiments using multiple approaches and feature configurations to predict either the review's platform or the literary genre. Findings The analysis of user-generated reviews demonstrates that language is a quite variable dimension across reading platforms, but not as much across book genres. The classification experiments revealed that features modelling the syntactic structure of the sentence are reliable proxies for discerning Amazon and Goodreads reviews, whereas lexical information showed a higher predictive role for automatically discriminating the genre. Originality/value The high availability of cultural products makes information services necessary to help users navigate these resources and acquire information from unstructured data. This study contributes to a better understanding of the linguistic characteristics of user-generated book reviews, which can support the development of linguistically-informed recommendation services. Additionally, the authors release a novel corpus of online book reviews meant to support the reproducibility and advancements of the research.",Journal of Documentation,2024

It categorizes the relevance aspects people consider when searching for these resources. The coding scheme and findings help search engines to better support complex information needs, both by prioritizing which aspects are easier to classify automatically and by determining which information sources should be considered. Design/methodology/approach A cross-domain classification scheme for relevance aspects and information needs in casual leisure domains (CRISPS) is developed and applied. The paper provides the documentation of the scheme development and annotation process as well as a detailed, large-scale analysis of 2000 requests (500 per domain) and relevance aspects for four domains as expressed in complex search requests in everyday life information seeking posted to online forums. Findings We identify and discuss relevance aspect frequencies, information need types and the described search process of the requests. Furthermore, the coding scheme development and the annotation process are documented and reflected on. Originality/value This is the first categorization and analysis of complex information needs in these four leisure domains combined. The coding scheme and findings can be used to develop new types of search interfaces that incorporate the kinds of relevance aspects identified in the scheme, allowing to express complex needs in the form of structured queries.",Journal of Documentation,2024
Readers’ interest criteria in fiction book search in library catalogs,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JDOC-11-2015-0142,"['Mikkonen, Anna', 'Vakkari, Pertti']","Purpose  – The purpose of this paper is to investigate fiction readers’ interest criteria when selecting novels in library catalogs for various search tasks.  Design/methodology/approach  – The data of the book selection behavior from 80 genuine fiction readers were collected using recorded interviews and conversations. The data were qualitatively analyzed. Reuter’s categorization of the components of aesthetic relevance has contributed to the construction of interest dimensions.  Findings  – A five-dimension categorization of interest criteria is presented based on fiction readers’ interpretations of the influential factors in fiction book selection in different search tasks. The findings revealed that readers apply the identified interest criteria in a flexible and multiphase way depending to the search task and the system used. The findings showed a context-related pattern in readers’ fiction book selections. A combination of readers’ search capacities, “behind the eyes” knowledge, affective factors and a well-functioning interaction with a system used results in a successful book selection.  Originality/value  – A five-dimension categorization of adult fiction readers’ interest criteria was created based on their search behaviors in library catalogs. The results provide a systematic step toward a comprehensive understanding of readers’ fiction book selection in digital environments.",Journal of Documentation,2016
"The trouble with diverse books, part I: on the limits of conceptual analysis for political negotiation in Library & Information Science",,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-04-2020-0057,"['Lawrence, E. E.']","Purpose The term diverse books is increasingly popular yet persistently nebulous. The purpose of this paper – Part I of II – is to illuminate both that the concept is in need of a unified account and that conceptual analysis, though at first seemingly quite promising, fails as a method for identifying one. Design/methodology/approach This paper utilizes traditional (or intuitive) conceptual analysis to specify the respective clusters of necessary and sufficient conditions that constitute four broad candidate accounts of diverse books. Findings Though diverse books is a concept in need of a definition, conceptual analysis is not an appropriate method for adjudicating between the definitions we have on offer. This is because the concept is fundamentally political, serving as a resource for re-shaping collective social arrangements and ways of life. The conceptual problem outlined here requires for its resolution a method that will move us from a descriptive project to an explicitly normative one, wherein we consider what we properly work to achieve with and through the concept in question. Originality/value This paper initiates a systematic analytical project aimed at defining diverse books. In illustrating a moment of methodological failure, it paves the way for a critical alternative – namely, Part II's proposal of an analytical intervention in which political concepts are defined partially in terms of their benefits vis-á-vis informational justice.",Journal of Documentation,2020
The role of agency in historians’ experiences of serendipity in physical and digital information environments,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-11-2015-0144,"['Martin, Kim', 'Quan-Haase, Anabel']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the changing research practices of historians, and to contrast their experiences of serendipity in physical and digital information environments. Design/methodology/approach In total, 20 historians in Southwestern Ontario participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed employing grounded theory. The analytical approach included memoing, the constant comparative method, and three phases of coding. Findings Four main themes were identified: agency, the importance of the physical library experience, digital information environments, and novel heuristic forms of serendipity. The authors found that scholars frequently used active verbs to describe their experience with serendipity. This suggests that agency is more involved in the experience than previous conceptualizations of serendipity have suggested, and led us to coin the term “incidental serendipity.” Other key findings include the need for digital tools to incorporate the context surrounding primary sources, and also to provide an organizational context much like what is encountered by patrons in library stacks. Originality/value The increased emphasis on digital materials should not come at the expense of the physical information environment, where historians often encounter serendipitous finds. A fine balance and a greater integration between digital and physical resources is needed in order to support scholars’ continued ability to make connections between materials. By showing the active role that historians take in their serendipitous encounters, this paper suggests that historical training is critical for eliciting incidental serendipitous encounters. The authors propose a novel approach, one that examines verbs in serendipity accounts.",Journal of Documentation,2016
Sender vs. recipient-orientated information systems revisited,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-10-2020-0177,"['MacFarlane, Andrew', 'Missaoui, Sondess', 'Makri, Stephann', 'Gutierrez Lopez, Marisela']","Purpose Belkin and Robertson (1976a) reflected on the ethical implications of theoretical research in information science and warned that there was potential for abuse of knowledge gained by undertaking such research and applying it to information systems. In particular, they identified the domains of advertising and political propaganda that posed particular problems. The purpose of this literature review is to revisit these ideas in the light of recent events in global information systems that demonstrate that their fears were justified. Design/methodology/approach The authors revisit the theory in information science that Belkin and Robertson used to build their argument, together with the discussion on ethics that resulted from this work in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The authors then review recent literature in the field of information systems, specifically information retrieval, social media and recommendation systems that highlight the problems identified by Belkin and Robertson. Findings Information science theories have been used in conjunction with empirical evidence gathered from user interactions that have been detrimental to both individuals and society. It is argued in the paper that the information science and systems communities should find ways to return control to the user wherever possible, and the ways to achieve this are considered. Research limitations/implications The ethical issues identified require a multidisciplinary approach with research in information science, computer science, information systems, business, sociology, psychology, journalism, government and politics, etc. required. This is too large a scope to deal with in a literature review, and we focus only on the design and implementation of information systems (Zimmer, 2008a) through an information science and information systems perspective. Practical implications The authors argue that information systems such as search technologies, social media applications and recommendation systems should be designed with the recipient of the information in mind (Paisley and Parker, 1965), not the sender of that information. Social implications Information systems designed ethically and with users in mind will go some way to addressing the ill effects typified by the problems for individuals and society evident in global information systems. Originality/value The authors synthesize the evidence from the literature to provide potential technological solutions to the ethical issues identified, with a set of recommendations to information systems designers and implementers.",Journal of Documentation,2022
User-centered categorization of mood in fiction,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-03-2022-0071,"['Cho, Hyerim', 'Lee, Wan-Chen', 'Huang, Li-Min', 'Kohlburn, Joseph']","Purpose Readers articulate mood in deeply subjective ways, yet the underlying structure of users' understanding of the media they consume has important implications for retrieval and access. User articulations might at first seem too idiosyncratic, but organizing them meaningfully has considerable potential to provide a better searching experience for all involved. The current study develops mood categories inductively for fiction organization and retrieval in information systems. Design/methodology/approach The authors developed and distributed an open-ended survey to 76 fiction readers to understand their preferences with regard to the affective elements in fiction. From the fiction reader responses, the research team identified 161 mood terms and used them for further categorization. Findings The inductive approach resulted in 30 categories, including angry, cozy, dark and nostalgic. Results include three overlapping mood families: Emotion, Tone/Narrative, and Atmosphere/Setting, which in turn relate to structures that connect reader-generated data with conceptual frameworks in previous studies. Originality/value The inherent complexity of “mood” should not dissuade researchers from carefully investigating users' preferences in this regard. Adding to the existing efforts of classifying moods conducted by experts, the current study presents mood terms provided by actual end-users when describing different moods in fiction. This study offers a useful roadmap for creating taxonomies for retrieval and description, as well as structures derived from user-provided terms that ultimately have the potential to improve user experience.",Journal of Documentation,2023
Analyzing anime users’ online forum queries for recommendation using content analysis,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-08-2017-0122,"['Cho, Hyerim', 'Schmalz, Marc L.', 'Keating, Stephen A.', 'Lee, Jin Ha']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of relevant information features for users seeking anime recommendations. Design/methodology/approach The study uses content analysis of 396 recommendation request threads from the online forum at Anime News Network. Findings In total, 19 important anime information features were identified, including Work, Theme, Genre, Audience, Mood, while Artwork/Visual Style, Audio Style, and Language were mentioned less frequently. However, when mentioned, these codes were discussed with specificity and depth. Research limitations/implications This study analyzed a relatively small number of 396 forum records, without demographic information. Using content analysis of online forum threads written by real users provided both informational breadth and depth. Future studies would benefit from using content analysis to investigate unfamiliar multimedia information and user groups. Practical implications The findings of this study can be implemented in anime-related databases and information systems to enhance organization, browsing/retrieval, and recommendation of anime, which can be further utilized for other audiovisual materials. Originality/value This is one of the few studies that investigate what anime users need and want. This research examines an understudied cultural medium, underserved by current research, despite an expanding community of anime users.",Journal of Documentation,2018
Information overload: a concept analysis,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-06-2021-0118,"['Belabbes, Mohamed Amine', 'Ruthven, Ian', 'Moshfeghi, Yashar', 'Rasmussen Pennington, Diane']","Purpose With the shift to an information-based society and to the de-centralisation of information, information overload has attracted a growing interest in the computer and information science research communities. However, there is no clear understanding of the meaning of the term, and while there have been many proposed definitions, there is no consensus. The goal of this work was to define the concept of “information overload”. In order to do so, a concept analysis using Rodgers' approach was performed. Design/methodology/approach A concept analysis using Rodgers' approach based on a corpus of documents published between 2010 and September 2020 was conducted. One surrogate for “information overload”, which is “cognitive overload” was identified. The corpus of documents consisted of 151 documents for information overload and ten for cognitive overload. All documents were from the fields of computer science and information science, and were retrieved from three databases: Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, SCOPUS and Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA). Findings The themes identified from the authors’ concept analysis allowed us to extract the triggers, manifestations and consequences of information overload. They found triggers related to information characteristics, information need, the working environment, the cognitive abilities of individuals and the information environment. In terms of manifestations, they found that information overload manifests itself both emotionally and cognitively. The consequences of information overload were both internal and external. These findings allowed them to provide a definition of information overload. Originality/value Through the authors’ concept analysis, they were able to clarify the components of information overload and provide a definition of the concept.",Journal of Documentation,2023
A new framework for ethical creation and evaluation of multi-perspective knowledge organization systems,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-04-2020-0053,"['Zhitomirsky-Geffet, Maayan', 'Hajibayova, Lala']","Purpose This study aims to present a new framework for ethical creation and evaluation of multi-perspective knowledge organization systems. Design/methodology/approach Applying Held's understanding of the ethics of care, this paper proposes five operative criteria for ethical building and evaluation of multi-perspective knowledge representation and organization systems. Findings This paper argues that a carefully designed multipoint view of representation and organization conforms to the proposed ethical criteria and shifts concerns associated with the expectation of neutrality of library information professionals to the necessity to humanize and diversify the representation and organization of knowledge to build inclusive and equitable systems. Originality/value This paper presents multi-perspectiveness as key to ethical knowledge organization. The paper proposes a generic taxonomy of the main stages in the creation of multi-perspective knowledge representation and organization systems and demonstrates how to apply the proposed framework in each stage to ensure ethical outcomes.",Journal of Documentation,2020
Gamifying piracy: functions and users of the Z-library,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-09-2021-0174,"['Kjellström, Zakayo']","Purpose This paper aims to show how an illegal repository of literature, the Z-library, relates to and influences its users and how this relation is unique due to the illegal nature of the platform. The paper utilizes the idea of gamification to exemplify how to motivate users to contribute to a large shadow library in order to create the “world's largest e-book library,” sans “librarians.” Design/methodology/approach The study makes use of an ethnographic approach. It interrogates the functions of the website through intensive use—a close reading of sorts. The data provide a foundation for illustrating how illegal text repositories function at a surface level and how their design appeals to their user-base. Findings The paper provides a thorough and non-biased overview of how a “black open access” or “shadow library” site provides its users with pirated literature. It suggests that the lynchpin sustaining their functionality is a gamification of piracy designed to motivate a fragmented collective of individuals who work primarily for personal reward, rather than altruistic goals. Research limitations/implications Due to the design of the study, the findings are not universal or applicable to all illegal repositories of text. Readers and researchers are encouraged to apply the concept introduced here to other cases. Social implications This paper includes implication on the perception of literature piracy, how pirated literature is distributed and who performs the labor required to sustain illicit text repositories. Originality/value This paper provides a novel conceptual basis to study literature piracy.",Journal of Documentation,2022
The role of readers’ literary preferences in predicting success in fiction search,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-01-2019-0005,"['Vakkari, Pertti', 'Mikkonen, Anna']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study what extent readers’ socio-demographic characteristics, literary preferences and search behavior predict success in fiction search in library catalogs. Design/methodology/approach In total, 80 readers searched for interesting novels in four differing search tasks. Their search actions were recorded with a Morae Recorder. Pre- and post-questionnaires elicited information about their background, literary preferences and search experience. Readers’ literary preferences were grouped into four orientations by a factor analysis. Linear regression analysis was applied for predicting search success as measured by books’ interest scores. Findings Most literary orientations contributed to search success, but in differing search tasks. The role of result examination was greater compared to querying in contributing search success almost in each task. The proportion of variance explained in books’ interest scores varied between 5 (open-ended browsing) and 50 percent (analogy search). Research limitations/implications The distribution of participants was biased toward females, and the results are aggregated within search session, both reducing the variation of the phenomenon observed. Originality/value This study is one of the first to explore how readers’ literary preferences and searching are associated with finding interesting novels, i.e. search success, in library catalogs. The results expand and support the findings in Mikkonen and Vakkari (2017) concerning associations between reader characteristics and fiction search success.",Journal of Documentation,2020
Illusions of a “Bond”: tagging cultural products across online platforms,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-09-2015-0110,"['Desrochers, Nadine', 'Laplante, Audrey', 'Martin, Kim', 'Quan-Haase, Anabel', 'Spiteri, Louise']","Purpose Most studies pertaining to social tagging focus on one platform or platform type, thus limiting the scope of their findings. The purpose of this paper is to explore social tagging practices across four platforms in relation to cultural products associated with the book Casino Royale, by Ian Fleming. Design/methodology/approach A layered and nested case study approach was used to analyse data from four online platforms: Goodreads, Last.fm, WordPress, and public library social discovery platforms. The top-level case study focuses on the book Casino Royale, by Ian Fleming and its derivative products. The analysis of tagging practices in each of the four online platforms is nested within the top-level case study. Casino Royale was conceptualized as a cultural product (the book), its derived products (e.g. movies, theme songs), as well as a keyword in blogs. A qualitative, inductive, and context-specific approach was chosen to identify commonalities in tagging practices across platforms whilst taking into account the uniqueness of each platform. Findings The four platforms comprise different communities of users, each platform with its own cultural norms and tagging practices. Traditional access points in the library catalogues focused on the subject, location, and fictitious characters of the book. User-generated content across the four platforms emphasized historical events and periods related to the book, and highlighted more subjective access points, such as recommendations, tone, mood, reaction, and reading experience. Revealing shifts occur in the tags between the original book and its cultural derivatives: Goodreads and library catalogues focus almost exclusively on the book, while Last.fm and WordPress make in addition cross-references to a wider range of different cultural products, including books, movies, and music. The analyses also yield apparent similarities in certain platforms, such as recurring terms, phrasing and composite or multifaceted tags, as well as a strong presence of genre-related terms for the book and music. Originality/value The layered and nested case study approach presents a more comprehensive theoretical viewpoint and methodological framework by which to explore the study of user-generated metadata pertaining to a range of related cultural products across a variety of online platforms.",Journal of Documentation,2016
Credibility on the internet: shifting from authority to reliability,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/00220410810899709,"['Lankes, R. David']","Purpose This paper seeks to understand how users determine credibility in the internet environment from a conceptual level and the implications of these new methods of credibility determination on internet tools (primarily software) and services. Design/methodology/approach The author first examines the underlying reasons for increased dependence on the internet for information, using electronic commerce as a starting point. The central concept of “information self‐sufficiency” is introduced and then examined through the lens of the internet and conversation theory. Findings The author finds that users are shifting from more traditional “authority” methods of credibility determination, where users cede determinations to trusted third parties, to a “reliability” approach where users seek commonalities and coherence among multiple information sources. This has led to an increased pressure for participation and openness at all levels of the internet. Research limitations/implications Studies on users and credibility must better account for often invisible technical factors. Practical implications Libraries must take into account a greater need for participation and technical fluency when dealing with patrons, particularly in information literacy programs and instruction. Originality/value This paper presents a large‐scale conceptual approach to credibility on the internet. It seeks to inform current approaches to the subject nested in communications and instruction with the unique technical environment of the internet.",Journal of Documentation,2008
Designing for serendipity: a means or an end?,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-12-2021-0234,"['Smets, Annelien']","Purpose This article aims to gain a better understanding of the reasons why serendipity is designed for in different kinds of environments. Understanding these design intents sheds light on the value such designs bring to designers, in contrast to the users of the environment. In this way, the article seeks to contribute to the literature on cultivating serendipity from a designers’ point of view. Design/methodology/approach An extensive review of the literature discussing designing for serendipity was conducted to elicit the different motivations to design for serendipity. Based on these findings and a thorough analysis, a typology of design intents for serendipity is presented. Findings The article puts forward four intents to design for serendipity: serendipity as an ideal, common good, mediator and feature. It also highlights that the current academic discourse puts a strong emphasis on two of them. It is argued that this academic abstraction could be problematic for how we deal with designs for serendipity, both in theory and practice. Originality/value The novelty of this article is that it addresses the question of why to design for serendipity from a designer’s point of view. By introducing the notion of directionality it opens up the opportunity to discuss serendipity from multiple perspectives, which contributes to gaining a firmer understanding of serendipity. It allows to more explicitly formulate the different functions of a design for serendipity and thereby expands our knowledge on the value of designing for serendipity. At the same time, it sheds light on the potential threats to designing for serendipity.",Journal of Documentation,2023
What do they make us see: a comparative study of cultural bias in online databases of two large museums,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-02-2022-0047,"['Zhitomirsky-Geffet, Maayan', 'Kizhner, Inna', 'Minster, Sara']","Purpose Large cultural heritage datasets from museum collections tend to be biased and demonstrate omissions that result from a series of decisions at various stages of the collection construction. The purpose of this study is to apply a set of ethical criteria to compare the level of bias of six online databases produced by two major art museums, identifying the most biased and the least biased databases. Design/methodology/approach At the first stage, the relevant data have been automatically extracted from all six databases and mapped to a unified ontological scheme based on Wikidata. Then, the authors applied ethical criteria to the results of the geographical distribution of records provided by two major art museums as online databases accessed via museums' websites, API datasets and datasets submitted to Wikidata. Findings The authors show that the museums use different artworks in each of its online databases and each data-base has different types of bias reflected by the study variables, such as artworks' country of origin or the creator's nationality. For most variables, the database behind the online search system on the museum's website is more balanced and ethical than the API dataset and Wikidata databases of the two museums. Originality/value By applying ethical criteria to the analysis of cultural bias in various museum databases aimed at different audiences including end users, researchers and commercial institutions, this paper shows the importance of explicating bias and maintaining integrity in cultural heritage representation through different channels that potentially have high impact on how culture is perceived, disseminated, contextualized and transformed.",Journal of Documentation,2023
User conceptualizations of derivative relationships in the bibliographic universe,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-10-2017-0139,"['Tallerås, Kim', 'Dahl, Jørn Helge B.', 'Pharo, Nils']","Purpose Considerable effort is devoted to developing new models for organizing bibliographic metadata. However, such models have been repeatedly criticized for their lack of proper user testing. The purpose of this paper is to present a study on how non-experts in bibliographic systems map the bibliographic universe and, in particular, how they conceptualize relationships between independent but strongly related entities. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on an open concept-mapping task performed to externalize the conceptualizations of 98 novice students. The conceptualizations of the resulting concept maps are identified and analyzed statistically. Findings The study shows that the participants’ conceptualizations have great variety, differing in detail and granularity. These conceptualizations can be categorized into two main groups according to derivative relationships: those that apply a single-entity model directly relating document entities and those (the majority) that apply a multi-entity model relating documents through a high-level collocating node. These high-level nodes seem to be most adequately interpreted either as superwork devices collocating documents belonging to the same bibliographic family or as devices collocating documents belonging to a shared fictional world. Originality/value The findings can guide the work to develop bibliographic standards. Based on the diversity of the conceptualizations, the findings also emphasize the need for more user testing of both conceptual models and the bibliographic end-user systems implementing those models.",Journal of Documentation,2018
Music questions in social Q&A: an analysis of Yahoo! Answers,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-02-2017-0024,"['Hertzum, Morten', 'Borlund, Pia']","Purpose Social question and answer (social Q&A) sites have become a popular tool for obtaining music information. The purpose of this paper is to investigate what users ask about, what experience the questions convey, and how users specify their questions. Design/methodology/approach A total of 3,897 music questions from the social Q&A site Yahoo! Answers were categorized according to their question type, user experience, and question specification. Findings The music questions were diverse with (dis)approval (42 percent), factual (21 percent), and advice (15 percent) questions as the most frequent types. Advice questions were the longest and roughly twice as long as (dis)approval and factual questions. The user experience associated with the questions was most often pragmatic (24 percent) or senso-emotional (12 percent). Pragmatic questions were typically about the user’s own performance of music, while senso-emotional questions were about finding music for listening. Notably, half of the questions did not convey information about the user experience but the absence of such information did not reduce the number of answers. In specifying the questions, the most frequent information was about the music context and the user context. Research limitations/implications This study suggests a division of labor between social Q&A sites and search engines for music information retrieval. It should be noted that the study is restricted to one social Q&A site. Originality/value Social Q&A sites provide an opportunity for studying what information real users seek about music and what information they specify to retrieve it, thereby elucidating the role of social Q&A in music information seeking.",Journal of Documentation,2017
Serendipity in human information behavior: a systematic review,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-02-2021-0029,"['Liu, Yaxi', 'Qin, Chunxiu', 'Ma, Xubu', 'Liang, Huigang']","Purpose Serendipitous information discovery has become a unique and important approach to discovering and obtaining information, which has aroused a growing interest for serendipity in human information behavior. Despite numerous publications, few have systematically provided an overview of current state of serendipity research. Consequently, researchers and practitioners are less able to make effective use of existing achievements, which limits them from making advancements in this domain. Against this backdrop, we performed a systematic literature review to explore the world of serendipity and to recapitulate the current states of different research topics. Design/methodology/approach Guided by a prior designed review protocol, this paper conducted both automatic and manual search for available studies published from January 1990 to December 2020 on seven databases. A total of 207 serendipity studies closely related to human information behavior form the literature pool. Findings We provide an overview of distinct aspects of serendipity, that is research topics, potential benefits, related concepts, theoretical models, contextual factors and data collection methods. Based on these findings, this review reveals limitations and gaps in the current serendipity research and proposes an agenda for future research directions. Originality/value By analyzing current serendipity research, developing a knowledge framework and providing a research agenda, this review is of significance for researchers who want to find new research questions or re-align current work, for beginners who need to quickly understand serendipity, and for practitioners who seek to cultivate serendipity in information environments.",Journal of Documentation,2022

Information encountering re-encountered,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-08-2019-0151,"['Erdelez, Sanda', 'Makri, Stephann']","Purpose In order to understand the totality, diversity and richness of human information behavior, increasing research attention has been paid to examining serendipity in the context of information acquisition. However, several issues have arisen as this research subfield has tried to find its feet; we have used different, inconsistent terminology to define this phenomenon (e.g. information encountering, accidental information discovery, incidental information acquisition), the scope of the phenomenon has not been clearly defined and its nature was not fully understood or fleshed-out. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, information encountering (IE) was proposed as the preferred term for serendipity in the context of information acquisition. Findings A reconceptualized definition and scope of IE was presented, a temporal model of IE and a refined model of IE that integrates the IE process with contextual factors and extends previous models of IE to include additional information acquisition activities pre- and postencounter. Originality/value By providing a more precise definition, clearer scope and richer theoretical description of the nature of IE, there was hope to make the phenomenon of serendipity in the context of information acquisition more accessible, encouraging future research consistency and thereby promoting deeper, more unified theoretical development.",Journal of Documentation,2020
Three key affordances for serendipity,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-07-2016-0097,"['Björneborn, Lennart']","Purpose Serendipity is an interesting phenomenon to study in information science as it plays a fundamental – but perhaps underestimated – role in how we discover, explore, and learn in all fields of life. The purpose of this paper is to operationalize the concept of serendipity by providing terminological “building blocks” for understanding connections between environmental and personal factors in serendipitous encounters. Understanding these connections is essential when designing affordances in physical and digital environments that can facilitate serendipity. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, serendipity is defined as what happens when we, in unplanned ways, encounter resources (information, things, people, etc.) that we find interesting. In the outlined framework, serendipity is understood as an affordance, i.e., a usage potential when environmental and personal factors correspond with each other. The framework introduces three key affordances for facilitating serendipity: diversifiability, traversability, and sensoriability, covering capacities of physical and digital environments to be diversified, traversed, and sensed. The framework is structured around couplings between the three key affordances and three key personal serendipity factors: curiosity, mobility, and sensitivity. Ten sub-affordances for serendipity and ten coupled personal sub-factors are also briefly outlined. Related research is compared with and mapped into the framework aiming at a theoretical validation. The affordance approach to serendipity is discussed, including different degrees and types of serendipity. Findings All the terminological “building blocks” in the framework are seen to resonate with the included related research. Serendipity is found to be a commonplace phenomenon in everyday life. It is argued that we cannot “engineer” nor “design” serendipity per se, but can design affordances for serendipity. Serendipity may thus be intended by designers, but must always be unplanned by users. The outlined affordance approach to serendipity points to the importance of our sensory-motor abilities to discover and explore serendipitous affordances. Research limitations/implications Implications of the framework for designing physical and digital environments with affordances for serendipity are briefly considered. It is suggested that physical environments may have a primacy regarding affordances of sensoriability for facilitating serendipity, and digital environments a primacy regarding traversability, whereas physical and digital environments may afford similar degrees of diversifiability. In future research, the framework needs further empirical validation in physical and digital environments. Originality/value No other research has been found addressing affordances for serendipity and connections between environmental and personal factors in similarly detailed ways. The outlined framework and typology may function as a baseline for further serendipity studies.",Journal of Documentation,2017
Information literacy as a site for anticipation: temporal tactics for infrastructural meaning-making and algo-rhythm awareness,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-11-2020-0204,"['Haider, Jutta', 'Sundin, Olof']","Purpose The article makes an empirical and conceptual contribution to understanding the temporalities of information literacies. The paper aims to identify different ways in which anticipation of certain outcomes shapes strategies and tactics for engagement with algorithmic information intermediaries. The paper suggests that, given the dominance of predictive algorithms in society, information literacies need to be understood as sites of anticipation. Design/methodology/approach The article explores the ways in which the invisible algorithms of information intermediaries are conceptualised, made sense of and challenged by young people in their everyday lives. This is couched in a conceptual discussion of the role of anticipation in understanding expressions of information literacies in algorithmic cultures. The empirical material drawn on consists of semi-structured, pair interviews with 61 17–19 year olds, carried out in Sweden and Denmark. The analysis is carried out by means of a qualitative thematic analysis in three steps and along two sensitising concepts – agency and temporality. Findings The results are presented through three themes, anticipating personalisation, divergences and interventions. These highlight how articulating an anticipatory stance works towards connecting individual responsibilities, collective responsibilities and corporate interests and thus potentially facilitating an understanding of information as co-constituted by the socio-material conditions that enable it. This has clear implications for the framing of information literacies in relation to algorithmic systems. Originality/value The notion of algo-rhythm awareness constitutes a novel contribution to the field. By centring the role of anticipation in the emergence of information literacies, the article advances understanding of the temporalities of information.",Journal of Documentation,2022

Socially meaningful transparency in data-based systems: reflections and proposals from practice,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-01-2023-0006,"['Bates, Jo', 'Kennedy, Helen', 'Medina Perea, Itzelle', 'Oman, Susan', 'Pinney, Lulu']","Purpose The purpose is to present proposals to foster what we call a socially meaningful transparency practice that aims to enhance public understanding of data-based systems through the production of accounts that are relevant and useful to diverse publics, and society more broadly. Design/methodology/approach The authors’ proposals emerge from reflections on challenges they experienced producing written and visual accounts of specific public sector data-based systems for research purposes. Following Ananny and Crawford's call to see limits to transparency practice as “openings”, the authors put their experience into dialogue with the literature to think about how we might chart a way through the challenges. Based on these reflections, the authors outline seven proposals for fostering socially meaningful transparency. Findings The authors identify three transparency challenges from their practice: information asymmetry, uncertainty and resourcing. The authors also present seven proposals related to reduction of information asymmetries between organisations and non-commercial external actors, enhanced legal rights to access information, shared decision making about what gets made transparent, making visible social impacts and uncertainties of data-systems, clear and accessible communication, timing of transparency practices and adequate resourcing. Social implications Socially meaningful transparency aims to enhance public understanding of data-based systems. It is therefore a necessary condition not only for informed use of data-based products, but crucially for democratic engagement in the development of datafied societies. Originality/value The paper contributes to existing debates on meaningful transparency by arguing for a more social, rather than individual, approach to imagining how to make transparency practice more meaningful. The authors do this through their empirical reflection on our experience of doing transparency, conceptually through our notion of socially meaningful transparency, and practically through our seven proposals.",Journal of Documentation,2024
"Confluence between library and information science and digital humanities in Spain. Methodologies, standards and collections",,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-02-2020-0030,"['Alvite-Díez, María-Luisa', 'Barrionuevo, Leticia']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the relevance of heritage collections and the convergence of methodologies and standards traditionally linked to Library and Information Science (LIS) in the development of digital humanities (DH) research in Spain. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a systematic review of scientific publications that are representative of DH in Spain and were published between 2013 and 2018. The analysis considered doctoral theses, journal articles and conference papers. Findings The results highlight the synergies between documentary heritage, LIS and DH. However, it appears that there is a scarcity of scientific literature to support the confluence of LIS and DH and a limited formal connection between heritage institutions and the areas of academia that reuse and enrich these source collections. Research limitations/implications The review of representative scholarly DH publications was mainly based on the metadata that describe the content of articles, thesis and conference papers. This work relies on the thematic indexing (descriptors and keywords) of the analysed documents but their level of quality and consistency is very diverse. Originality/value The topic of the study has not been explored before and this work could contribute to the international debate on the interrelation and complementarity between LIS and DH. In addition, this paper shows the contribution that standards and documentary methodologies make to projects in which technology is applied to humanities disciplines. The authors propose that there is an urgent need to strengthen the “scientific relationships” between heritage institutions, as well as enhancing links between the academic field of DH and LIS in order to improve teaching and research strategies in conjunction.",Journal of Documentation,2021
“Write the story you want to read”: world-queering through slash fanfiction creation,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-11-2019-0217,"['Floegel, Diana']","Purpose This pilot study explores how queer slash fanfiction writers reorient cis/heteronormative entertainment media (EM) content to create queer information worlds. Design/methodology/approach Constructivist grounded theory was employed to explore queer individuals' slash fanfiction reading and creation practices. Slash fanfiction refers to fan-written texts that recast cis/heteronormative content with queer characters, relationships, and themes. Theoretical sampling drove ten semi-structured interviews with queer slash writers and content analysis of both Captain America slash and material features found on two online fanfiction platforms, Archive of Our Own and fanfiction.net. “Queer” serves as a theoretical lens through which to explore non-cis/heteronormative perspectives on gender and sexuality. Findings Participants' interactions with and creation of slash fanfiction constitute world-queering practices wherein individuals reorient cis/heteronormative content, design systems, and form community while developing their identities over time. Findings suggest ways that queer creators respond to, challenge, and reorient cis/heteronormative narratives perpetuated by EM and other information sources, as well as ways their practices are constrained by structural power dynamics. Research limitations/implications This initial data collection only begins to explore the topic with ten interviews. The participant sample lacks racial diversity while the content sample focuses on one fandom. However, results suggest future directions for theoretical sampling that will continue to advance constructs developed from the data. Originality/value This research contributes to evolving perspectives on information creation and queer individuals' information practices. In particular, findings expand theoretical frameworks related to small worlds and ways in which members of marginalized populations grapple with exclusionary normativity.",Journal of Documentation,2020

Design/methodology/approach Music-related information is approached through six modes that categorize music information sources based on their levels of abstraction. Situational relevance of the modes of music information is examined in relation to the situational requirements of accomplishing a dissertation on music task consisting of both a series of concerts and a written thesis. The empirical material was collected by interviewing Finnish doctoral students in the field of music performance. Findings A set of situational relevance types related to each mode of music information were identified. As a whole, the differences between the perceived importance of the modes varied a little. Research limitations/implications The goal of the present paper is not to create a generalizable list of situational relevance types suggested by modes of music information, but to show that the modes may suggest diverse situational relevance types of their own when evaluated by performing musicians. Originality/value The present paper provides a rare account on performing musicians’ vocational and school-related information seeking. For studies of music information retrieval, the present paper offers new contextual facets explaining why diverse music information could be relevant to musicians. For studies of music-related information seeking, the present study offers new insights on why performing musicians have information needs regarding certain types of music information sources.",Journal of Documentation,2018

Fighting fake news: exploring George Orwell's relationship to information literacy,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-11-2019-0223,"['Haggar, Ellen']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse George Orwell's diaries through an information literacy lens. Orwell is well known for his dedication to freedom of speech and objective truth, and his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four is often used as a lens through which to view the fake news phenomenon. This paper will examine Orwell's diaries in relation to UNESCO's Five Laws of Media and Information Literacy to examine how information literacy concepts can be traced in historical documents. Design/methodology/approach This paper will use a content analysis method to explore Orwell's relationship to information literacy. Two of Orwell's political diaries from the period 1940–42 were coded for key themes related to the ways in which Orwell discusses and evaluates information and news. These themes were then compared to UNESCO Five Laws of Media and Information Literacy. Textual analysis software NVivo 12 was used to perform keyword searches and word frequency queries in the digitised diaries. Findings The findings show that while Orwell's diaries and the Five Laws did not share terminology, they did share ideas on bias and access to information. They also extend the history of information literacy research and practice by illustrating how concerns about the need to evaluate information sources are represented within historical literature. Originality/value This paper combines historical research with textual analysis to bring a unique historical perspective to information literacy, demonstrating that “fake news” is not a recent phenomenon, and that the tools to fight it may also lie in historical research.",Journal of Documentation,2020
Knowledge management issues for online organisations: ‘communities of practice’ as an exploratory framework,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007077,"['Davenport, Elisabeth']","Communities of practice have been identified as sites where knowledge is created in organisations. The author reviews studies of situated learning and situated action and suggests that these two activities may characterise the learning process in communities of practice where they are supported by a distinctive ‘social’ infrastructure. She analyses recent fieldwork in three online communities (a digital library reference service, a virtual enterprise and an online shopping group) to discover to what extent they may be described as communities of practice, and to establish how they support participants’ learning.",Journal of Documentation,2001
"Rereading, art-making and other joys: toward a theory of information, repetition and the good life",,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-01-2021-0011,"['Gorichanaz, Tim']","Purpose This paper offers a conceptual discussion of repetition and joy in the context of information and their relation to the good life. Design/methodology/approach Joy is defined as an integrative element of the good life which can be achieved through repetition. This may be surprising, given that our most ready-to-hand associations with “repetition” are negative in tenor rather than positive. Building on the work of repetition theorists Søren Kierkegaard and Gertrude Stein, we can discern three different forms of repetition: that looking backwards (e.g. rereading), that looking forwards (e.g. art-making) and that looking inwards (e.g. chiasmus). Throughout this paper, information-related examples are given and discussed as vignettes that move the conversation forward. Findings These examples lead to a nascent theory of why the repetition of information can spark joy and not just tedium. First, its stability and predictability that instill comfort in us. Second, its unifying force that brings us to experience wholeness. Third, its invitation to keep the repetition going through creation, further helping us feel part of the world. And finally, its paradoxicality—as strict repetition is impossible—which requires change, paving the way for satisfying surprises and delights. Originality/value Repetition is a ubiquitous and theoretically interesting phenomenon when it comes to information, and though it is implicit in some information science research, it has not yet been theorized directly. Moreover, this paper connects this issue to an emerging “positive” orientation in information studies.",Journal of Documentation,2021
Adopting situationally relevant modes of music information at different stages of information-seeking processes,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-12-2018-0210,"['Rousi, Antti Mikael', 'Savolainen, Reijo', 'Vakkari, Pertti']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to elaborate the picture of situational relevance by examining how modes of music information are viewed as situationally relevant at different stages of information-seeking processes among music students. Design/methodology/approach Empirical data of the present longitudinal study were collected in two phases by utilizing questionnaire and interview methods. Informants comprised of 14 university-level music students representing the fields of music performance, music education and music theory and composition. Modes of music information were approached through the information typology presented by Rousi, Savolainen and Vakkari. Findings The findings indicate that not only the modes of music information were seen as situationally relevant for different reasons by the three participating music student groups when at the beginning of their tasks, but also that the perceived situational relevance of the information modes underwent changes as their tasks progressed to focus formulation and post-focus stages. Research limitations/implications Due to the small number of participants, further research is needed to verify the results concerning the differences in information-seeking processes between diverse music student groups. Originality/value The paper showcases that approaching music information through frameworks that classify information sources at diverse levels of abstraction enables an accurate description of information-seeking processes and illuminates context-sensitive development of situational relevance of music information of diverse modes.",Journal of Documentation,2019
"Research status, hotspots and trends for information behavior in China using bibliometric and co-word analysis",,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-10-2016-0125,"['Shen, Lining', 'Xiong, Bing', 'Hu, Jiming']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the research status and outputs of information behavior in China in order to reveal its in-depth research pattern and trends. Design/methodology/approach The author collected literature during the past 29 years from China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database. Bibliometric analysis, including publication growth analysis, core authors and collaborative degree analysis, core journals analysis, and institutions distribution, was performed. The temporal visualization map of burst term was drawn, and the co-occurrence matrix of these keywords was analyzed by the hierarchical cluster analysis, strategic diagram, and social network analysis. Findings The earliest article on information behavior in China was published in 1987. And the number of articles has risen continually since then, which follows the logical growth law of literature. The collaborative degree of authors is on the rise in general. The distribution of these articles obeys the Bradford’s Law of Scattering. School of Information Management of Wuhan University remarkably ranks the top in most publications. In all, ten important research directions were identified, which are in the imbalanced development. And a newly appearing topic with great potential for further development, namely information seeking and information security, is identified. Originality/value This study provides important insights into the research status and trends on information behavior in China, which might provide a potential guide for the future research.",Journal of Documentation,2017
A knowledge organization framework for influencing tourism-centered place-making,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-12-2020-0220,"['Ghosh, Shiv Shakti', 'Chatterjee, Sunil Kumar']","Purpose This study demonstrates the synthesis of a knowledge organization framework from tourist reviews and an ontological model with its implementation in graph database, which is based on this framework. The aim is to influence place-making outcomes at tourist destinations. Design/methodology/approach The faceted classification approach has been used for generating and validating the framework based on online reviews about urban tourism parks. The framework was used to develop an ontology using Protégé ontology editor that was implemented using GraphDB. Findings Three fundamental facet categories, namely Component, Aspect and Outcome, each consisting of several sub-facets, were synthesized from the analyses of the reviews. Besides helping in constructing the ontology, the analysis also helped in calculating an importance-score for the reviews that helped in ranked information retrieval. Research limitations/implications The analyses of the reviews were done manually and may carry human bias. But it is robust as it is based on a canonical faceted methodology. Practical implications It is envisaged that this study will help tourist destination planners in decision-making by easing the utilization of tourist generated reviews by the knowledge management systems they use. Opinions of tourists will be induced in destination planning thereby helping in the production of quality “places.” Originality/value The presented faceted framework aims to specifically aid knowledge organization pertaining to online reviews related to tourist destinations. The focus is on organizing knowledge to facilitate tourism development for better place-making outcomes, which is an important area of research though it has little contributions.",Journal of Documentation,2022
What people study when they study Tumblr,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-08-2016-0101,"['Attu, Rose', 'Terras, Melissa']","Purpose Since its launch in 2007, research has been carried out on the popular social networking website Tumblr. The purpose of this paper is to identify published Tumblr-based research, classify it to understand approaches and methods, and provide methodological recommendations for others. Design/methodology/approach Research regarding Tumblr was identified. Following a review of the literature, a classification scheme was adapted and applied, to understand research focus. Papers were quantitatively classified using open coded content analysis of method, subject, approach, and topic. Findings The majority of published work relating to Tumblr concentrates on conceptual issues, followed by aspects of the messages sent. This has evolved over time. Perceived benefits are the platform’s long-form text posts, ability to track tags, and the multimodal nature of the platform. Severe research limitations are caused by the lack of demographic, geo-spatial, and temporal metadata attached to individual posts, the limited Advanced Programming Interface, restricted access to data, and the large amounts of ephemeral posts on the site. Research limitations/implications This study focusses on Tumblr: the applicability of the approach to other media is not considered. The authors focus on published research and conference papers: there will be book content which was not found using the method. Tumblr as a platform has falling user numbers which may be of concern to researchers. Practical implications The authors identify practical barriers to research on the Tumblr platform including lack of metadata and access to big data, explaining why Tumblr is not as popular as Twitter in academic studies. Social implications This paper highlights the breadth of topics covered by social media researchers, which allows us to understand popular online platforms. Originality/value There has not yet been an overarching study to look at the methods and purpose of those who study Tumblr. The authors identify Tumblr-related research papers from the first appearing in 2011 July until 2015 July. The classification derived here provides a framework that can be used to analyse social media research, and in which to position Tumblr-related work, with recommendations on benefits and limitations of the platform for researchers.",Journal of Documentation,2017
Feeling documents: toward a phenomenology of information seeking,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-09-2016-0113,"['Keilty, Patrick', 'Leazer, Gregory']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present two models of human cognition. The first narrow model concentrates on the mind as an information-processing apparatus, and interactions with information as altering thought structures and filling gaps in knowledge. A second model incorporates elements of unconsciousness, embodiment and affect. The selection of one model over the other, often done tacitly, has consequences for subsequent models of information seeking and use. Design/methodology/approach A close reading of embodied engagements with pornography guided by existential phenomenology. Findings The paper develops a phenomenology of information seeking, centered primarily around the work of Merleau-Ponty, to justify a more expansive concept of cognition. The authors demonstrate the roles of affect and embodiment in document assessment and use, with a prolonged example in the realm of browsing pornography. Originality/value Models of information seeking and use need to account for diverse kinds of human-document interaction, to include documents such as music, film and comics that engage the emotions or are perceived through a broader band of sensory experience to include visual and auditory components. The authors consider how those human-document engagements form virtual communities based on the similarity of their members’ affective and embodied responses, which in turn inform the arrangements, through algorithms, of the relations of documents to each other. Less instrumental forms of information seeking and use – ones that incorporate elements of embodiment and affect – are characterized as esthetic experiences, following the definition of the esthetic provided by Dewey. Ultimately the authors consider, given the ubiquity of information seeking and its rhythm in everyday life, whether we can meaningfully characterize information seeking as a distinct human process.",Journal of Documentation,2018
Images as data – modelling data interactions in social science and humanities research,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-08-2024-0195,"['Late, Elina', 'Matres, Inés', 'Sendra, Anna', 'Kumpulainen, Sanna']","Purpose The expanded reuse of images as research data in the social sciences and humanities necessitates the understanding of scholars’ real-life interactions with the type of data. The aim of this study is to analyse activities constituting image data interactions in social science and humanities research and to provide a model describing the data interaction process. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on interviews with 21 scholars from various academic backgrounds utilising digital and print images collected from external sources as empirical research data. Qualitative content analyses were executed to analyse image data interactions throughout the research process in three task types: contemporary, historical and computational research. Findings The findings further develop the task-based information interaction model (Järvelin et al., 2015) originally created to explain the information interaction process. The enhanced model presents five main image data interaction activities: Data gathering, Forming dataset, Working with data, Synthesizing and reporting and Concluding, with various sub-activities. The findings show the variety of image data interactions in different task types. Originality/value The developed model contributes to understanding critical points in image data interactions and provides a model for future research analysing research data interactions. The model may also be used, for example, in designing better research services and infrastructures by identifying support needs throughout the research process.",Journal of Documentation,2024
Towards a diversified knowledge organization system,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-10-2018-0163,"['Zhitomirsky-Geffet, Maayan']","Purpose The need for inclusive and logically consistent representation of diverse and even confronting viewpoints on the domain knowledge has been widely discussed in the literature in the past decade. The purpose of this paper is to propose a generic model for building an open coherent diversified knowledge organization system (KOS). Design/methodology/approach The proposed model incorporates a generic epistemological component, the validity scope type, assigned to each statement in the constructed KOS. Statements are clustered by their association with various validity scope types into internally coherent subsystems. These subsystems form a knowledge organization network connected through the universal (consensual) subsystems with more than one validity scope type. The model extends the Galili’s Cultural Content Representation paradigm, which divides the knowledge content of a scientific theory into two confronting parts: body and periphery. Findings The knowledge organization network model makes it possible to comparatively examine similarities and differences among various viewpoints and theories on the domain knowledge. The presented approach conforms with the principle of Open Knowledge Network initiative for creation of open accessible knowledge. Practical implications The proposed model can be used for ontological reasoning by a variety of information services, such as ontology-based decision-support and learning systems, diversified search and customer management applications. Social implications The model enables explicit representation of social and cultural minority voices and historical knowledge in the KOS. Originality/value The main contribution of the proposed model is that it generalizes and enhances various previously proposed representations of epistemological aspects of KOS and allows for multiple inter-linked subsystems to coherently co-exist as part of the extensible network.",Journal of Documentation,2019
The role of historical and contextual knowledge in enterprise search,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-08-2021-0170,"['Lykke, Marianne', 'Bygholm, Ann', 'Søndergaard, Louise Bak', 'Byström, Katriina']","Purpose The purpose of the study is to examine enterprise searching practices across different work areas and work tasks in an enterprise search system in an international biotechnology company. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach studying employees' authentic search activities during a 4-month period by log data, questionnaire survey and interviews. The log data analysed the entire active searcher group, whereas the questionnaire and interviews focused on frequent searchers. Findings The three studies provided insight into the searching activities and an understanding of the way searchers used the enterprise search system to search for information as part of their work tasks. The data identified three searcher groups, each with specific search characteristics. Four work task types were identified, and for all four types the searchers applied a tracing searching technique with use of contextual and historical relationships as paths. Practical implications The findings point to the importance of knowledge on historical and contextual relations in enterprise search. Originality/value The work sheds new light on enterprise searchers' information search practices. A significant contribution is the identification of a tracing search method used in relation to four essential work task types. Another contribution is the importance of historical and contextual knowledge to support the tracing search and decide what paths to follow.",Journal of Documentation,2022
Determining the critical thresholds for co-word network based on the theory of percolation transition,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-06-2019-0117,"['Tang, Muh-Chyun', 'Teng, Weijen', 'Lin, Miaohua']","Purpose One of the chief purposes of bibliometric analysis is to reveal the intellectual structure of a knowledge domain. Yet due to the magnitude and the heterogeneous nature of bibliometric networks, some sorts of filtering procedures are often required to make the resulting network interpretable. A co-word analysis of more than 135,000 scholarly publications on Buddhism was conducted to compare the intellectual structure of Buddhist studies in three language communities, Chinese, English and Japanese, over two periods (1957–1986 and 1987–2016). Six co-word similarity networks were created so social network analysis-based community-detection algorithm can be identified to compare major research themes in different languages and eras. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach A series of filtering procedures was performed to exclude less discriminatory keywords and spurious relationships of a large, cross-language co-word network in Buddhist studies. Chief among the filtering heuristics was a percolation-transition based method to determine the similarity threshold that involves observing the relative decrease of nodes in the giant component with the increasing similarity threshold. Findings It was found that the topical patterns in the Chinese and Japanese scholarship of Buddhism are alike and observably distinct from that of the English scholarship. Furthermore, a far more drastic changes of research themes were observed in the English literature relative to the Chinese and Japanese literature. Originality/value The filtering procedures were shown to greatly enhance the modularity values and limited the number of modularity classes; thus, domain expert interpretation is feasible.",Journal of Documentation,2020
Algorithmic detection of misinformation and disinformation: Gricean perspectives,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-05-2017-0075,"['Søe, Sille Obelitz']","Purpose With the outset of automatic detection of information, misinformation, and disinformation, the purpose of this paper is to examine and discuss various conceptions of information, misinformation, and disinformation within philosophy of information. Design/methodology/approach The examinations are conducted within a Gricean framework in order to account for the communicative aspects of information, misinformation, and disinformation as well as the detection enterprise. Findings While there often is an exclusive focus on truth and falsity as that which distinguish information from misinformation and disinformation, this paper finds that the distinguishing features are actually intention/intentionality and non-misleadingness/misleadingness – with non-misleadingness/misleadingness as the primary feature. Further, the paper rehearses the argument in favor of a true variety of disinformation and extends this argument to include true misinformation. Originality/value The findings are novel and pose a challenge to the possibility of automatic detection of misinformation and disinformation. Especially the notions of true disinformation and true misinformation, as varieties of disinformation and misinformation, which force the true/false dichotomy for information vs mis-/disinformation to collapse.",Journal of Documentation,2018
Information retrieval (IR) and the paradox of change,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/00220411211225601,"['Thornley, Clare']","Purpose This paper aims to explore whether philosophical insights from Plato's dialogue “Parmenides” on the complex and often paradoxical nature of change can illuminate the nature of information retrieval (IR). IR is modelled as a dialectic process involving mutually dependent yet conflicting forces between the subjective and the objective. These forces operate to produce change in the subjective experience of users (becoming informed) through facilitating a relationship with objective documents. Accurately modelling, predicting and enabling this process remains a persistent problem for IR and this paper seeks to examine the extent to which this is because of the nature of change. Design/methodology/approach The paper is a conceptual analysis and literature review. Findings The problem of change (what it is, how it happens and how we can know it has happened) is essential to our understanding of information as information normally implies some kind of change in knowledge state. Any process of change, however, on examination of its qualities, appears to necessitate the combination of irreconcilable and conflicting forces. The apparent contradictions within the existence of change as discussed in “Parmenides” also exist in IR on both a theoretical and a technical level. Research limitations/implications Change is a central concept for information in general and IR in particular. A deeper understanding of the paradoxical nature of change can provide new insights into IR theory and practice. Originality/value The paper presents a new historical philosophical perspective on the nature of change and applies it to current IR problems.",Journal of Documentation,2012
The preferences of Chinese LIS journal articles in citing works outside the discipline,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-04-2017-0057,"['Chen, Chuanfu', 'Li, Qiao', 'Deng, Zhiqing', 'Chiu, Kuei', 'Wang, Ping']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand how Chinese library and information science (LIS) journal articles cite works from outside the discipline (WOD) to identify the impact of knowledge import from outside the discipline on LIS development. Design/methodology/approach This paper explores the Chinese LIS’ preferences in citing WOD by employing bibliometrics and machine learning techniques. Findings Chinese LIS citations to WOD account for 29.69 percent of all citations, and they rise over time. Computer science, education and communication are the most frequently cited disciplines. Under the categorization of Biglan model, Chinese LIS prefers to cite WOD from soft science, applied science or nonlife science. In terms of community affiliation, the cited authors are mostly from the academic community, but rarely from the practice community. Mass media has always been a citation source that is hard to ignore. There is a strong interest of Chinese LIS in citing emerging topics. Practical implications This paper can be implemented in the reformulation of Chinese LIS knowledge system, the promotion of interdisciplinary collaboration, the development of LIS library collection and faculty advancement. It may also be used as a reference to develop strategies for the global LIS. Originality/value This paper fills the research gap in analyzing citations to WOD from Chinese LIS articles and their impacts on LIS, and recommends that Chinese LIS should emphasize on knowledge both on technology and people as well as knowledge from the practice community, cooperate with partners from other fields, thus to produce knowledge meeting the demands from library and information practice as well as users.",Journal of Documentation,2018
Integrated use of KOS and deep learning for data set annotation in tourism domain,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-02-2023-0019,"['Aracri, Giovanna', 'Folino, Antonietta', 'Silvestri, Stefano']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology for the enrichment and tailoring of a knowledge organization system (KOS), in order to support the information extraction (IE) task for the analysis of documents in the tourism domain. In particular, the KOS is used to develop a named entity recognition (NER) system. Design/methodology/approach A method to improve and customize an available thesaurus by leveraging documents related to the tourism in Italy is firstly presented. Then, the obtained thesaurus is used to create an annotated NER corpus, exploiting both distant supervision, deep learning and a light human supervision. Findings The study shows that a customized KOS can effectively support IE tasks when applied to documents belonging to the same domains and types used for its construction. Moreover, it is very useful to support and ease the annotation task using the proposed methodology, allowing to annotate a corpus with a fraction of the effort required for a manual annotation. Originality/value The paper explores an alternative use of a KOS, proposing an innovative NER corpus annotation methodology. Moreover, the KOS and the annotated NER data set will be made publicly available.",Journal of Documentation,2023
Social noise: the influence of observers on social media information behavior,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-08-2021-0165,"['Zimmerman, Tara']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of social noise. Under the influence of social noise, a social media user may adjust information behavior based on external cues, attempting to present themselves in a more desirable way to increase their social capital. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study informed by an ethnographic approach was used to examine social media information behavior. Participants were observed using Facebook, followed by semi-structured interviews. Data analysis was theoretically grounded in thematic analysis but also adaptive to observations in the data. Findings Four constructs of social noise were identified in the data. Identity curation emerged as the overarching consideration for individuals. The constructs cultural commitments and relationship management both had a strong presence within the data as well. The fourth construct, conflict management, was identified as social media users decided how to respond to individuals or information with which they did not agree. Originality/value This study reveals that social media users' awareness of observation by others does impact their information behavior. Efforts to craft a personal reputation, build or maintain relationships, pursue important commitments and manage conflict all influence the observable information behavior of social media users. As a result, observable social media information behavior may not be an accurate reflection of an individual's true thoughts and beliefs.",Journal of Documentation,2022
Cognitive styles and search engine preferences,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/00220411011052966,"['Clewley, Natalie', 'Chen, Sherry Y.', 'Liu, Xiaohui']","Purpose Cognitive style has been identified to be significantly influential in deciding users' preferences of search engines. In particular, Witkin's field dependence/independence has been widely studied in the area of web searching. It has been suggested that this cognitive style has conceptual links with the holism/serialism. This study aims to investigate the differences between the field dependence/independence and holism/serialism. Design/methodology/approach An empirical study was conducted with 120 students from a UK university. Riding's cognitive style analysis (CSA) and Ford's study preference questionnaire (SPQ) were used to identify the students' cognitive styles. A questionnaire was designed to identify users' preferences for the design of search engines. Data mining techniques were applied to analyse the data obtained from the empirical study. Findings The results highlight three findings. First, a fundamental link is confirmed between the two cognitive styles. Second, the relationship between field dependent users and holists is suggested to be more prominent than that of field independent users and serialists. Third, the interface design preferences of field dependent and field independent users can be split more clearly than those of holists and serialists. Originality/value The contributions of this study include a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between field dependence/independence and holists/serialists as well as proposing a novel methodology for data analyses.",Journal of Documentation,2010
PERCIRS: a system to combine personalized and collaborative information retrieval,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/00220411011052948,"['Naderi, Hassan', 'Rumpler, Beatrice']","Purpose This paper aims to discuss and test the claim that utilization of the personalization techniques can be valuable to improve the efficiency of collaborative information retrieval (CIR) systems. Design/methodology/approach A new personalized CIR system, called PERCIRS, is presented based on the user profile similarity calculation (UPSC) formulas. To this aim, the paper proposes several UPSC formulas as well as two techniques to evaluate them. As the proposed CIR system is personalized, it could not be evaluated by Cranfield, like evaluation techniques (e.g. TREC). Hence, this paper proposes a new user‐centric mechanism, which enables PERCIRS to be evaluated. This mechanism is generic and can be used to evaluate any other personalized IR system. Findings The results show that among the proposed UPSC formulas in this paper, the (query‐document)‐graph based formula is the most effective. After integrating this formula into PERCIRS and comparing it with nine other IR systems, it is concluded that the results of the system are better than the other IR systems. In addition, the paper shows that the complexity of the system is less that the complexity of the other CIR systems. Research limitations/implications This system asks the users to explicitly rank the returned documents, while explicit ranking is still not widespread enough. However it believes that the users should actively participate in the IR process in order to aptly satisfy their needs to information. Originality/value The value of this paper lies in combining collaborative and personalized IR, as well as introducing a mechanism which enables the personalized IR system to be evaluated. The proposed evaluation mechanism is very valuable for developers of personalized IR systems. The paper also introduces some significant user profile similarity calculation formulas, and two techniques to evaluate them. These formulas can also be used to find the user's community in the social networks.",Journal of Documentation,2010
