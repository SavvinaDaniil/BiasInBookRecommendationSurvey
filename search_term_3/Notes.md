## Friday, 8 November 2024

**Decision:** For the Journal of Documentation, I did this search term: ("book" OR "books" OR "library" OR "libraries") AND ("recommender system" OR "recommendation system" OR "recommendation systems" OR "recommender systems") AND (bias OR diversity OR diverse)

I CHANGED ALL THE COMMAS TO ENDS IN CATALOGUING CLASSIFICATION SO THE PARSER WORKS.

I joined everything and now I have 182 entries. Ill start screening them. Do they discuss bias in recommendation of books in the libraries?

Ideas to solve the fact that I hardly find anything:
- Maybe I should look into bias in collections?
- Switch to 'recommendation service'?
- Broaden bias&diversity: discrimination, fairness...


I need to think my search better. What do I need from this search? Papers that discuss the following:
1. Importance and form of recommending diverse books to users
2. Potential biases that can arise from automatic recommendation of books to users

STOP FOR NOW AND THINK. WHAT SHOULD YOU CHANGE?
