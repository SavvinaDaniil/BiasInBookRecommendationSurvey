## Friday, 8 November 2024

**Decision:** For the Journal of Documentation, I did this search term: ("book" OR "books" OR "library" OR "libraries") AND ("recommender system" OR "recommendation system" OR "recommendation systems" OR "recommender systems") AND (bias OR diversity OR diverse)

I CHANGED ALL THE COMMAS TO ENDS IN CATALOGUING CLASSIFICATION SO THE PARSER WORKS.

I joined everything and now I have 182 entries. Ill start screening them. Do they discuss bias in recommendation of books in the libraries?

Ideas to solve the fact that I hardly find anything:
- Maybe I should look into bias in collections?
- Switch to 'recommendation service'?
- Broaden bias&diversity: discrimination, fairness...


I need to think my search better. What do I need from this search? Papers that discuss the following:
1. Importance and form of recommending diverse books to users
2. Potential biases that can arise from automatic recommendation of books to users

STOP FOR NOW AND THINK. WHAT SHOULD YOU CHANGE?


## Monday, 11 November 2024

**Issue to fix:** I don't seem to actually have retrieved papers that have these terms for cataloguing & classification quarterly. Re-check it.


## Tuesday, 12 November 2024

Go on with the next venue, and we'll figure it out.

## Thursday, 14 November 2024
Ok let's do it. We'll talk tomorrow with Laura about details but for now let's check the papers we have.

0 out of 6...


The word seek? information seeking? personalized...? search? library discovery systems (masked by trust)?
inclusivity? represented?

Include library hitech news from: Ethical artificial intelligence (AI): confronting bias and discrimination in the library and information industry

https://library.ifla.org/

become member of the mailing list for AI. Ask there about good selection. https://www.ifla.org/g/ai/get-involved-4/


do freeform search to come up with better terms. Start analyzing the technical papers.




## This is what I'm doing now
- General search
- Note down better terms

Save everything at mendeley freeform.

Additional interesting venues: code4lib journal, Library hi tech news, 

Idea: It is also a lot about cataloguing! [See](https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/items/f3c5994d-f7d7-4682-9ed1-9eefcee05154)


A library discovery tool is defined in this paper as a search engine that builds on unified indexes of licensed scholarly information, searches across multiple library databases provided by different vendors, and may be customized for its size, range and comprehensiveness of data inclusion for targeted solutions.[see](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=60590)

Informational Justice: A Conceptual Framework for Social Justice in Library and
Information Services 1


I read a few papers. 

Not everything I find is about recommendation --  A LOT of it is about search results.

To do:
- Finish reading the paper by Mathiesen
- Look at the citations of Mathiesen 

I want to look a bit at the technical papers again.


## Thursday, 21 November 2024

- [ ] Finish reading the paper by Mathiesen
- [ ] Look at the citations of Mathiesen
- [ ] Read final report for Project Laibro
