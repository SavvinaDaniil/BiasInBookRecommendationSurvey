Popularity bias refers to the problem that popular items (i.e., frequently rated items) are recommended frequently while less popular items are recommended rarely or not at all. Researchers adopted two approaches to examining popularity bias: (i) from the users’ perspective, by analyzing how far a recommendation system deviates from user’s expectations in receiving popular items, and (ii) by analyzing the amount of exposure that long-tail items receive, measured by overall catalog coverage and novelty. In this paper, we examine the first point of view in the book domain, although the findings may be applied to other domains as well. To this end, we analyze the well-known Book-Crossing dataset and define three user groups based on their tendency towards popular items (i.e., Niche, Diverse, Bestseller-focused). Further, we evaluate the performance of nine state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and two baselines (i.e., Random, MostPop) from both the accuracy (e.g., NDCG, Precision, Recall) and popularity bias perspectives. Our results indicate that most state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in the book domain, and fail to meet users’ expectations with Niche and Diverse tastes despite having a larger profile size. Conversely, Bestseller-focused users are more likely to receive high-quality recommendations, both in terms of fairness and personalization. Furthermore, our study shows a tradeoff between personalization and unfairness of popularity bias in recommendation algorithms for users belonging to the Diverse and Bestseller groups, that is, algorithms with high capability of personalization suffer from the unfairness of popularity bias. Finally, across the models, our results show that WMF and VAECF can provide a higher quality recommendation when considering both accuracy and fairness perspectives. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This study therefore examines the impacts of key factors from theories of information systems (IS) success and sense of community (SOC) on users' continuance intention in the social cataloging context. Data collected from an online survey of 323 social cataloging users provide empirical support for the research model. The findings indicate that both information quality (IQ) and system quality (SQ) are significant predictors of satisfaction and SOC, which in turn lead to users' intentions to continue using these sites. In addition, SOC was found to affect continuance intention not only directly, but also indirectly through satisfaction. Theoretically, this study draws attention to a largely unexplored but essential area of research in the social cataloging literature and provides a fundamental basis to understand the determinants of continued social cataloging usage. From a managerial perspective, the findings suggest that social cataloging service providers should constantly focus their efforts on the quality control of their contents and system, and the enhancement of SOC among their users. © 2015 ASIS&T"

This work provides a systematic study on the impact of broadly chosen data characteristics (DCs) of recommender systems. This is applied to the accuracy and fairness of several variations of CF recommendation models. We focus on a suite of DCs that capture properties about the structure of the user–item interaction matrix, the rating frequency, item properties, or the distribution of rating values. Experimental validation of the proposed system involved large-scale experiments by performing 23,400 recommendation simulations on three real-world datasets in the movie (ML-100K and ML-1M) and book domains (BookCrossing). The validation results show that the investigated DCs in some cases can have up to 90% of explanatory power – on several variations of classical CF algorithms –, while they can explain – in the best case – about 40% of fairness results (measured according to user gender and age sensitive attributes). Therefore, this work evidences that it is more difficult to explain variations in performance when dealing with fairness dimension than accuracy. © 2021 The Authors"

Many of these patterns reflect important real-world phenomena driving interactions between the various users and items; other patterns may be irrelevant or reflect undesired discrimination, such as discrimination in publishing or purchasing against authors who are women or ethnic minorities. In this work, we examine the response of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms to the distribution of their input data with respect to one dimension of social concern, namely content creator gender. Using publicly available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data. We find that common collaborative filtering algorithms tend to propagate at least some of each user’s tendency to rate or read male or female authors into their resulting recommendations, although they differ in both the strength of this propagation and the variance in the gender balance of the recommendation lists they produce. The data, experimental design, and statistical methods are designed to be reusable for studying potentially discriminatory social dimensions of recommendations in other domains and settings as well. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V."

Therefore, a recommendation system that predicts users' taste is an essential factor for the success of businesses. However, recommendation systems require users' personal information and can thus lead to serious privacy violations. To solve this problem, many research has been conducted about protecting personal information in recommendation systems and implementing differential privacy, a privacy protection technique that inserts noise into the original data. However, previous studies did not examine the following factors in applying differential privacy to recommendation systems. First, they did not consider the sparsity of user rating information. The total number of items is much more than the number of user-rated items. Therefore, a rating matrix created for users and items will be very sparse. This characteristic renders the identification of user patterns in rating matrixes difficult. Therefore, the sparsity issue should be considered in the application of differential privacy to recommendation systems. Second, previous studies focused on protecting user rating information but did not aim to protect the lists of user-rated items. Recommendation systems should protect these item lists because they also disclose user preferences. In this study, we propose a differentially private recommendation scheme that bases on a grouping method to solve the sparsity issue and to protect user-rated item lists and user rating information. The proposed technique shows better performance and privacy protection on actual movie rating data in comparison with an existing technique. © 2020 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE.

For a recommender system, all the ratings in the rating matrix are bounded within a pre-determined range. In this paper, we propose a new improved matrix factorization approach for such a rating matrix, called Bounded Matrix Factorization (BMF), which imposes a lower and an upper bound on every estimated missing element of the rating matrix. We present an efficient algorithm to solve BMF based on the block coordinate descent method. We show that our algorithm is scalable for large matrices with missing elements on multicore systems with low memory. We present substantial experimental results illustrating that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art algorithms for recommender system such as stochastic gradient descent, alternating least squares with regularization, SVD++ and Bias-SVD on real-world datasets such as Jester, Movielens, Book crossing, Online dating and Netflix. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London."

This study aimed to explore the impact of e-marketing factors for agricultural products on the sustainable consumer behaviour. The technology acceptance model (TAM) and the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model were used to investigate the factors that trigger long-term behavioural changes towards more sustainable consumer behaviour. Trust and continuance intention (CI) constitute sustainable consumer behaviours. The survey-based data were collected from 172 farmers in and around the Al-Baha province of Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal that, out of the six factors, social influence (SI), hedonic motives (HM), and perceived risk (PR) had a significant impact on trust whereas the perceived usefulness (PU), information quality (IQ), and the perceived ease of use (PEOU) had an insignificant impact on trust. Trust appears to had a substantial positive impact on the development of CI. Furthermore, the significant moderation of age and the insignificant moderation of education are observed among trust–CI relationship. Therefore, policymakers should concentrate on the factors such as SI and decrease the factors that are related to the PR in order to achieve a higher level of trust. This study contributes to the literature on e-marketing of agricultural products resulting in the formation of CI that triggers long-term behavioural changes towards more sustainable consumer behaviour. © 2022 by the authors."

One approach to mitigate this undesired behavior is to recommend items with high potential for serendipity, namely surprising items that are likely to be highly rated. In this paper, we propose a content-based formulation of serendipity that is rooted in Bayesian surprise and use it to measure the serendipity of items after they are consumed and rated by the user. When coupled with a collaborative-filtering component that identifies similar users, this enables recommending items with high potential for serendipity. To facilitate the evaluation of topic-level models for surprise and serendipity, we introduce a dataset of book reading histories extracted from Goodreads, containing over 26 thousand users and close to 1.3 million books, where we manually annotate 449 books read by 4 users in terms of their time-dependent, topic-level surprise. Experimental evaluations show that models that use Bayesian surprise correlate much better with the manual annotations of topic-level surprise than distance-based heuristics, and also obtain better serendipitous item recommendation performance. © 2023 ACM."

Addressing this challenge, we envision a recommendation simulator, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in human-level intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose Agent4Rec, a user simulator in recommendation, leveraging LLM-empowered generative agents equipped with user profile, memory, and actions modules specifically tailored for the recommender system. In particular, these agents' profile modules are initialized using real-world datasets (e.g., MovieLens, Steam, Amazon-Book), capturing users' unique tastes and social traits; memory modules log both factual and emotional memories and are integrated with an emotion-driven reflection mechanism; action modules support a wide variety of behaviors, spanning both taste-driven and emotion-driven actions. Each agent interacts with personalized recommender models in a page-by-page manner, relying on a pre-implemented collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithm. We delve into both the capabilities and limitations of Agent4Rec, aiming to explore an essential research question: ""To what extent can LLM-empowered generative agents faithfully simulate the behavior of real, autonomous humans in recommender systems?""Extensive and multi-faceted evaluations of Agent4Rec highlight both the alignment and deviation between agents and user-personalized preferences.

In the last two decades, user-generated book reviews on social media have opened up unprecedented research possibilities for humanities and social sciences (HSS) scholars who are interested in book reception. However, limitations and gaps have emerged from existing DH research which utilize social media data for answering HSS questions. To shed light on the under-investigated features of user-generated book reviews and the challenges they might pose to scholarly research, we conducted three exemplar cases studies: (1) a longitudinal analysis for profiling the temporal changes of ratings and popularity of 552 books across ten years; (2) a cross-cultural comparison of book ratings of the same 538 books across two platforms; and, (3) a classification experiment on 20,000 sponsored and non-sponsored books reviews. Correspondingly, our research reveals the real-world complexities and under-investigated features of user-generated book reviews in three dimensions: The transience of book ratings and popularity (temporal dimension), the cross-cultural differences in reading interests and book reception (cultural dimension), and the user power dynamics behind the publicly accessible reviews (""political"" dimension). Our case studies also demonstrate the challenges posed by user-generated book reviews' real-world complexities to their scholarly usage and propose solutions to these challenges.

In this article, we propose a method to improve user satisfaction by generating unexpected recommendations based on the utility theory of economics. In particular, we propose a new concept of unexpectedness as recommending to users those items that depart from what they would expect from the system - the consideration set of each user. We define and formalize the concept of unexpectedness and discuss how it differs from the related notions of novelty, serendipity, and diversity. In addition, we suggest several mechanisms for specifying the users' expectations and propose specific performance metrics to measure the unexpectedness of recommendation lists. We also take into consideration the quality of recommendations using certain utility functions and present an algorithm for providing users with unexpected recommendations of high quality that are hard to discover but fairly match their interests.

This paper proposes a double ensemble recommendation model that combines two collaborative filtering algorithms, K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Matrix Factorization (MF). KNN is a neighbourhood-based algorithm that uses the similarity between users or items to make recommendations. At the same time, MF is a model-based algorithm that decomposes the user-item rating matrix into lower-dimensional matrices representing the latent user and item factors. The proposed double ensemble model uses KNN and MF to predict missing ratings matrix and combines their predictions using stacking. To evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble model, we conducted experiments on three datasets i.e. Movielense, BookCrossing dataset and Hindi Movie dataset and compared the results with those of single algorithm approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the double ensemble model outperforms the single algorithm approaches regarding accuracy metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results indicate that stacked KNN and MF lead to a more robust and more accurate recommendation system. © (2023), All Rights Reserved."

Comparing thousands of reader reviews on Goodreads.com of 64 English-language books that either won or were short-listed for prestigious book awards between 2007 and 2011, we find that prizewinning books tend to attract more readers following the announcement of an award and that readers' ratings of award-winning books tend to decline more precipitously following the announcement of an award relative to books that were named as finalists but did not win. We explain this surprising result, focusing on two mechanisms whereby signals of quality that tend to promote adoption can subsequently have a negative impact on evaluation. First, we propose that the audience evaluating a high-status actor or object tends to shift as a result of a public status shock, like an award, increasing in number but also in diverse tastes. We outline how this shift might translate into less favorable evaluations of quality. Second, we show that the increase in popularity that tends to follow a status shock is off-putting to some, also resulting in more negative evaluations.

Despite their superior ranking performance, these methods can learn neighborhoods that inadvertently foster discriminatory patterns. Little work exists in this area, highlighting an important research gap. A notable yet solitary effort, Balanced Neighborhood Sparse LInear Method (BNSLIM) aims at balancing neighborhood influence across different demographic groups. Yet, BNSLIM is hampered by computational inefficiency, and its rigid balancing approach often impacts accuracy. In that vein, we introduce two novel algorithms. The first, an enhancement of BNSLIM, incorporates the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to optimize all similarities concurrently, greatly reducing training time. The second, Fairly Sparse Linear Regression (FSLR), induces controlled sparsity in neighborhoods to reveal correlations among different demographic groups, achieving comparable efficiency while being more accurate. Their performance is evaluated using standard exposure metrics alongside a new metric for user coverage disparities. Our experiments cover various applications, including a novel exploration of bias in course recommendations by teachers' country development status.

Existing content-aware approaches often struggle to effectively distinguish the relative importance of content features and typically lack generalizability when processing new data.

Our model incorporates a double-tower network (DT-Net) that learns user and item representations through a meta-encoder and a mutual attention encoder, effectively mitigating the impact of noisy data on auxiliary information. By framing the cold-start problem as few-shot meta-learning, we employ a model-agnostic meta-optimization strategy to train the model across a variety of tasks during the meta-learning phase. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets—ShortVideos, MovieLens, and Book-Crossing—demonstrate the superiority of our model in cold-start recommendation scenarios.

A two-stage joint learning solution is designed in the proposed model, which combines user attributes, item attributes, and user-item interaction information into a unified framework. The convolutional neural network and attention mechanism are applied to improve effect of extracting features from user and item attributes. The extended deep neural network model based on matrix factorization and multiple-layer perception is used to enhance the feature extraction of user and item interaction information.

User studies represent a viable alternative to online and offline evaluation schemes, but despite their numerous benefits, they are only rarely used. One of the main reasons behind this fact is that preparing a user study from scratch involves a lot of extra work on top of a simple algorithm proposal. To simplify this task, we propose EasyStudy, a modular framework built on the credo ""Make simple things fast and hard things possible"". It features ready-to-use datasets, preference elicitation methods, incrementally tuned baseline algorithms, study flow plugins, and evaluation metrics. As a result, a simple study comparing several RS can be deployed with just a few clicks, while more complex study designs can still benefit from a range of reusable components, such as preference elicitation. Overall, EasyStudy dramatically decreases the gap between the laboriousness of offline evaluation vs. user studies and, therefore, may contribute towards the more reliable and insightful user-centric evaluation of next-generation RS.

Therefore, we study four multimedia datasets, i.e., Last.fm, MovieLens, BookCrossing and MyAnimeList, that we each split into three user groups differing in their inclination to popularity, i.e., LowPop, MedPop and HighPop. Using these user groups, we evaluate four collaborative filtering-based algorithms with respect to popularity bias on the item and the user level. Our findings are three-fold: firstly, we show that users with little interest into popular items tend to have large user profiles and thus, are important data sources for multimedia recommender systems.

These recommendations are made based on the broad assumption that people who have agreed on some things in the past will likely agree on things in the future. [1] Because these systems classify content based on how it is engaged with by previous users, they have emerged as an effective (and profitable) way to organize content on the web, the web itself being resistant, almost by its very nature, to the imposition of top-down, ontological classificatory control. [2] This paper interrogates some of the assumptions and biases involved in the personalized organization and presentation of digital media content, in an effort to devise a more critical analysis of the economic, technical, and social forces that contribute to the growing popularity of the personalized recommender systems. It pays particular attention to how personalized content filtering finds expression in the recommendation engines of taste-coordinating websites like Amazon and Pandora, in the self-organization of information through social classification sites like LibraryThing and Delicious, in the adaptive capabilities of next generation search engines (what Michael Zimmer refers to as ""Search 2.0""), and finally within locational media software like FourSquare. Discussion of these recommender systems will refer to their mechanics as well as their accompanying rhetoric, which often associates the personalized delivery of content with a more empowered individual user. Promises of individual empowerment attached to emerging expressions of personalized media are generally made in opposition to the broadcast media model of the mass market. The concluding section of this paper will examine the rhetoric of these promises in a discussion that considers such novel adaptations of content production and delivery as a market response to current media configurations. These adaptations, it will be argued, serve in large part to define differences to be ""commercially exploited.""

It addresses, on the one hand, the data confidentiality during the training, by exploring federated learning and trusted authority mechanisms. On the other hand, it deals with data quantity, and quality by exploring both transformers and consumer clustering. The process starts by clustering the consumers into similar clusters using contrastive learning and k-means algorithm. The local model of each consumer is trained on the local data. The local models of the consumers with the clustering information are then sent to the server, where integrity verification is performed by a trusted authority. Instead of traditional federated learning solutions, two kinds of aggregation are performed. The first one is the aggregation of all models of the consumers to derive the global model. The second one is the aggregation of the models of each cluster to derive a local model of similar consumers. Both models are sent to the consumers, where each consumer decides which appropriate model might be used for personal recommendation. Robust experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the applicability of the method using MovieLens-1M, and Amazon-book.

PRAs are a type of Web personalization technology that provides individual consumers with product recommendations based on their product-related needs and preferences expressed explicitly or implicitly. Whereas extant research mainly assumes that such recommendation technologies are designed to benefit consumers and focuses on the positive impact of PRAs on consumers' decision quality and decision effort, this study represents an early effort to examine PRAs that are designed to produce their recommendations on the basis of benefiting e-commerce merchants (rather than benefiting consumers) and to investigate how the availability and the design of warning messages (a potential detection support mechanism) can enhance consumers' performance in detecting such biased PRAs. Drawing on signal detection theory, the literature on warning messages, and the literature on message framing, we identified two content design characteristics of warning messages-the inclusion of risk-handling advice and the framing of risk-handling advice-and investigated how they influence consumers' detection performance. The results of an online experiment reveal that a simple warning message without accompanying advice on how to detect bias is a double-edged sword, because it increases correct detection of biased PRAs (hits) at the cost of increased incorrect detection (false alarms). By contrast, including in warning messages risk-handling advice about how to check for bias (particularly when the advice is framed to emphasize the loss from not following the advice) increases correct detection and, more importantly, also decreases incorrect detection. The patterns of findings are in line with the predictions of signal detection theory. With an enriched understanding of how the availability and the content design of warning messages can assist consumers in the context of PRA-assisted online shopping, the results of this study serve as a basis for future theoretical development and yield valuable insights that can guide practice and the design of effective warning messages. © 2015 INFORMS."

However, existing contrast learning-based KGR models still have the following limitations. First, existing methods failed to suppress the interference information of unnecessary neighbouring nodes in the knowledge graph because graph convolution is used to directly aggregate all neighbouring nodes; Second, focusing only on the global information would lead to ignoring the fine-grained local features, causing over-smooth issues. In this work, a Knowledge-aware Recommender System with Cross-Views Contrastive Learning (KRSCCL) is proposed to address the aforementioned issues. In the KRSCCL, a relational graph attention network is proposed to construct a global view, including user, item and entity nodes. A lightweight graph convolutional network is designed to construct a local view, including user and item nodes, in which local features are emphasized to effectively mitigate the over-smooth problem. Finally, the contrastive learning mechanism is performed between intra- and inter-graph node pairs of the two views to fully extract KG signals and further optimize the user and item representations.

Since the goal of the knowledge graph learning task is to restore the relationship of the triples in the knowledge graph, rather than to accomplish the recommendation task, it is difficult for the knowledge graph learning task to efficiently help the recommendation task improve the recommendation performance. In addition, user’s interest is easily affected by short-term environment and mood. This paper proposes a recommendation model that is a multi-task feature learning approach for knowledge graph and short-term preferences enhanced recommendation (MKASR) in response to the above two points. Firstly, the RippleNet algorithm is used to extract the relationship pairs between the user and the knowledge graph entity, and then these relationship pairs are stored in the form of knowledge graph triples for participating in training. The bidirectional GRU (gate recurrent unit) network based on the attention mechanism is adopted from the user’s recent interaction sequence of items to extract the user’s short-term preferences. Secondly, this paper uses the multi-task learning method to train the knowledge graph learning module and the recommendation module. And the feature representation between user and item can be obtained. Finally, these feature representations and the short-term preferences of users are taken into account to make comprehensive recommendations to users.

The present paper measures the accuracy of users’ short-term surfing on recommendation networks in retrieving historical interests, and the diversity of visited objects during such surfing. Analytical results based on three empirical datasets and three similarity algorithms show that, providing more recommendations in the list can promote the diversity of objects that the users could potentially visit. However, these recommendations may also divert users’ attention from the most relevant ones, leading to decreased retrieval accuracy. To achieve the best accuracy, recommendation lists need to be relatively short, depending on the expected surfing duration and the applied similarity algorithms. Consequently, this study uncovers the profound impact of recommendation network connectedness on the short-term surfing accuracy and diversity, and thereby highlights the necessity of tailoring the often-overlooked recommendation list length for enhanced navigation efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Relevant research has long focused on refining and improving these models to produce better (more effective) recommendations, and has converged on a methodology to predict their effectiveness on target datasets by evaluating them on random samples of the latter. However, predicting the efficiency of the solutions - especially with regard to their time- and resource-hungry training phase, whose requirements dwarf those of the prediction/recommendation phase - has received little to no attention in the literature. This article addresses this gap for a number of representative and highly popular CF models, including algorithms based on matrix factorization, k-nearest neighbors, co-clustering, and slope one schemes. To this end, we first study the computational complexity of the training phase of said CF models and derive time and space complexity equations. Then, using characteristics of the input and the aforementioned equations, we contribute a methodology for predicting the processing time and memory usage of their training phase.

While collaborative filtering systems are popular with many state-of-the-art achievements in recommender systems, they suffer from the cold start problem, when there is no history about the users and items. Further, the latent factors learned by these methods are linear in nature. To address these gaps, we describe a novel hybrid recommender system using deep learning. The solution uses embeddings for representing users and items to learn non-linear latent factors. The solution alleviates the cold start problem by integrating side information about users and items into a very deep neural network. The proposed solution uses a decreasing learning rate in conjunction with increasing weight decay, the values cyclically varied across epochs to further improve accuracy. The proposed solution is benchmarked against existing methods on both predictive accuracy and running time. Predictive Accuracy is measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. Running time is measured by the mean and standard deviation across seven runs. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several datasets such as the MovieLens 100 K, FilmTrust, Book-Crossing and MovieLens 1 M. The results show that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods in both non-cold start and cold start cases. The proposed solution framework is generic from the outperformance on four different datasets and can be leveraged for other ratings prediction datasets in recommender systems. © 2019"

With the PRNs as the virtual shelves, this paper explores the impact of the distance between products on the formation of product electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM). Employing an empirical book recommendation network of Amazon, the study one explores the effect of a focal product’s neighborhood (nearby others) on its eWOM, and study two explores the eWOM similarity between product pairs that are at one, two and three clicks away from each other. The results reveal the significant role played by the product distance on the association of their eWOM. On one hand, a focal product’s eWOM is largely influenced by that of its neighborhood. On the other hand, the good connectivity between two products, which is defined as the number of paths connecting them, is closely associated with the eWOM similarity between them.

This algorithm explores the internal connections of knowledge graphs to discover the potential relationship between users and items. On the user side, this paper proposes a method of aggregating user neighbor information. In the relational space of the knowledge graph, the knowledge graph is used to spread and extract the user s potential interest, and iteratively inject the potential interest into the user characteristics with attention bias to generate user embedding representation vector. At the item side, the user vector that aggregates the users neighbor information is sent to the KGCN (knowledge graph convolutional networks) model, and when the polymer product and its neighbor information are used, a new aggregation method is used to generate the item embedding representation. Finally, the obtained vector is sent to train. Through the inner product operation of the vector and normalization, the association score between the user and the item is obtained. Then the training is carried out in the training set to optimize the parameters. Comparative experiments are conducted on two public datasets. Compared with the baseline, on the Book-Crossing dataset, AUC and ACC are increased by 1.72% and 4.24% , and on the Last.FM dataset, AUC and ACC are increased by 1.07% and 1.14% .

This can be achieved by modeling the user–item interaction graph to capture user preferences for items. Despite the promising results achieved by these algorithms, they still suffer from the issue of data sparsity. In order to mitigate the impact of data sparsity, contrastive learning has been adopted in graph collaborative filtering to enhance performance. However, current recommendation algorithms using contrastive learning yield uneven representations after data augmentation and do not consider the potential relationships among users (or items). To address these challenges, we propose a graph neural network-based recommendation model that integrates contrastive learning (GNNCL). This model combines data augmentation with added noise and the exploration of semantic neighbors for nodes. For the structural neighbors on the interaction graph, we introduce a novel and straightforward contrastive learning approach, abandoning previous graph augmentation methods, and introducing uniform noise into the embedding space to create contrastive views. To unearth potential semantic neighbor relationships in the semantic space, we assume that users with similar representations possess semantic neighbor relationships and merge these semantic neighbors into the prototype contrastive learning. We utilize a clustering algorithm to obtain prototypes for users and items and employ the EM algorithm for prototype contrastive learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Particularly, on the Yelp2018 and Amazon-book datasets, our method exhibits significant performance improvements compared to basic graph collaborative filtering models. © The Author(s) 2024."

Design – Data analysis of publicly available book sales rankings and reader ratings. Setting – The internet. Subjects – 192 New York Times hardcover fiction best seller titles from 2018, and 1,367 Goodreads ratings posted in 2018. Methods – Data were collected using Application Programming Interfaces. The researchers retrieved weekly hardcover fiction best seller rankings published by the New York Times in 2018 in CSV file format. All 52 files, each containing bibliographic data for 15 hardcover fiction titles, were combined and duplicate titles removed, resulting in 192 unique best seller titles. The researchers retrieved reader ratings of the 192 best seller titles from Goodreads. The ratings were limited to those posted in 2018 by the top Goodreads reviewers. A Bayes estimator produced a list of the top ten highest rated New York Times best sellers. The researchers built the recommender system using Python and employed several content-based and collaborative filtering recommender techniques (e.g., cosine similarity, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and matrix factorization algorithms) to identify novels similar to the highest rated best sellers. Main Results – Each recommender technique generated a different list of novels. Conclusion – The main finding from this study is that recommender systems can simplify collection development for librarians and facilitate greater access to relevant library materials for users. Academic libraries can use the same recommender techniques employed in the study to identify titles similar to highly circulated monographs or frequently requested interlibrary loans. There are several limitations to using recommender systems in libraries, including privacy concerns when analyzing user behaviour data and potential biases in machine-learning algorithms. © 2024 Hancock."

Each of them has distinctive criteria of relevance in information retrieval. On the other hand, the application of those criteria determines what information the user receives. Content-based search places emphasis on the contents of retrievable documents whereas collaborative search shifts the focus of attention to opinions of experts and other users. The outcomes of content-based and collaborative searches diverge as a result. Depending on the information provided to the user, the development of her knowledge and socialization proceeds differently. A plea for customized Web search is made.

Graph Convolution Network(GCN), which is one of the representative works of graph structure aggregation processing, works by node convolution with the help of the Laplacian matrix of the graph and weighted combination of neighbor node information according to the outgoing and incoming degrees of neighbor nodes to obtain the representation of the current node. However, the mainstream GCN models nowadays do not take into account data augmentation of metadata and the fact that each node plays different roles with different importance and weights, thus making the recommendation performance limited.

Existing graph neural networks (GNN) based methods achieve satisfactory performance by exploiting the high-order connectivity between users and items, however they suffer from the poor training efficiency problem and easily introduce bias for information propagation. Moreover, the widely applied Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) loss is insufficient to provide supervision signals for training due to the extremely sparse observed interactions. To deal with the above issues, we propose the Efficient Graph Collaborative Filtering (EGCF) method. Specifically, EGCF adopts merely one-layer graph convolution to model the collaborative signal for users and items from the first-order neighbors in the user–item interactions. Moreover, we introduce contrastive learning to enhance the representation learning of users and items by deriving the self-supervisions, which is jointly trained with the supervised learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, i.e., Yelp2018 and Amazon-book, and the experimental results demonstrate that EGCF can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in terms of Recall and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), especially on ranking the target items at right positions. In addition, EGCF shows obvious advantages in the training efficiency compared with the competitive baselines, making it practicable for potential applications. © 2021 by the authors.

A user expects the system to remember past interactions and not conduct each recommendation round as a stand-alone process. Additionally, group recommendation systems are more prominent since more and more people are able to form groups for activities. Subsequently, the data that a group recommendation system needs to consider becomes more complicated — historical data and feedback for each user, the items recommended and ultimately selected to and by the group, etc. This makes the selection of a group recommendation algorithm to be even more complex. In this work, we propose the SQUIRREL framework — SeQUentIal Recommendations with ReinforcEment Learning, a model that relies on reinforcement learning techniques to select the most appropriate group recommendation algorithm based on the current state of the group. At each round of recommendations, we calculate the satisfaction of each group member, how relevant each item in the group recommendation list is for each user, and based on this the model selects an action, that is, a recommendation algorithm out of a predefined set that will produce the maximum reward. We present a sample of methods that can be used; however, the model is able to be further configured with additional actions, different definitions of rewards or states. We perform experiments on three real world datasets, 20M MovieLens, GoodReads and Amazon, and show that SQUIRREL is able to outperform all the individual recommendation methods used in the action set, by correctly identifying the recommendation algorithm that maximizes the reward function utilized. © 2022 The Author(s)"

In response, we propose a solution that treats the collaborative neighbors of the anchor node as positive samples within the final objective loss function. This paper focuses on developing two unique supervised contrastive loss functions that effectively combine supervision signals with contrastive loss. We analyze our proposed loss functions through the gradient lens, demonstrating that different positive samples simultaneously influence updating the anchor node’s embeddings.

We present substantial experimental results illustrating that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art algorithms for recommender systems such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Alternating Least Squares with regularization, SVD++, Bias-SVD on real world data sets such as Jester, Movielens, Book crossing, Online dating and Netflix. © 2012 IEEE."

However, most of the existing recommendation models highly depended on abundant and high-quality datasets and neglected the alignment and uniformity of embedding representation. The noisy and skewed distribution of data from real-world applications is ubiquitous. The alignment and uniformity are crucial for representation learning. In this paper, we propose SHTAU (self-supervised hypergraph transformer with alignment and uniformity for the recommendation) to address the problem. Specifically, we first perform a graph neural network on the user-item interaction graph, then captures the global collaboration relationship between users and items through the hypergraph transformer structure, and use the extracted global information to generate self-supervised signals for data enhancement on the user-item interaction graph to enhance the robustness of the recommendation algorithm. Simultaneously, alignment and uniformity auxiliary task update embeddings from different angles to improve performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on Yelp, Gowalla, MovieLens, Amazon-book and Tmall datasets. The experimental results show that SHTAU has obvious advantages over the baseline methods. © (2024), (International Association of Engineers). All Rights Reserved."

Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used to improve recommendation performance. To verify that knowledge graphs can further alleviate the above problems, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework that uses attentive knowledge graph perceptual propagation for recommendations (AKGP). This framework uses a knowledge graph as a source of auxiliary information to extract user–item interaction information and build a sub-knowledge base. The fusion of structural and contextual information is used to construct fine-grained knowledge graphs via knowledge graph embedding methods and to generate initial embedding representations. Through multi-layer propagation, the structured information and historical preference information are embedded into a unified vector space, and the potential user–item vector representation is expanded. This article used a knowledge perception attention module to achieve feature representation, and finally, the model was optimized using the stratified sampling joint learning method. Compared with the baseline model using MovieLens-1M, Last-FM, Book-Crossing and other data sets, the experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods, and the shortcomings of the existing model are improved. The model was applied to product design data and historical maintenance records provided by an automotive parts manufacturing company. The predictions of the recommended system are matched to the product requirements and possible failure records. This helped reduce costs and increase productivity, helping the company to quickly determine the cause of failures and reduce unplanned downtime. © 2023 by the authors."

Model-based collaborative filtering utilized the ratings of the user–item matrix dataset to generate a prediction. Essentially, this type of intelligent system plays a critical role in e-commerce, social network, and popular domains increasingly. In this research work, we present the comparison of the two widely used efficient techniques such as Biased Matrix Factorization and a regular Matrix Factorization, both using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We have conducted experiments on two real-world public datasets: Book Crossing and Movie Lens 100 K and evaluated by two metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Our experiments demonstrated that Biased Matrix Factorization used SGD technique results in a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy for rating prediction in experimental both datasets. Compute with a regular Matrix Factorization technique, Biased Matrix Factorization produced the reduction of the RMSE by 25.78% and MAE by 19.69% for Book Crossing dataset and RMSE by 19.69% and MAE by 14.08% for Movie Lens 100 K dataset. As expected when comparing the results of different datasets, Biased Matrix Factorization using SGD materialize less prediction error. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

From Goodreads to TikTok, customers of internet products become more addicted to the products thanks to the technology. Industrial practitioners focus on increasing the technical accuracy of recommender systems while at same time balancing other factors such as diversity and serendipity. In spite of the length of the research and development history of recommender systems, there has been little discussion on how to take advantage of visualization techniques to facilitate the algorithmic design of the technology. In this paper, we use a series of data analysis and visualization techniques such as Takens Embedding, Determinantal Point Process and Social Network Analysis to help people develop effective recommender systems by predicting intermediate computational cost and output performance. Our work is pioneering in the field, as to our limited knowledge, there have been few publications (if any) on visualization of recommender systems. © 2022 IEEE."
