Exploring author gender in book rating and recommendation,Yes,"Using publicly available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data. bookcrossing etc",User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-020-09284-2,Michael D.

What recommenders recommend: an analysis of recommendation biases and possible countermeasures,Yes,we show that popular recommendation techniques—despite often being similar when compared with the help of accuracy measures—can be quite different with respect to which items they recommend.

A bias detection tree approach for detecting disparities in a recommendation model’s errors,Yes,a model-agnostic technique to automatically detect the combinations of user and item attributes correlated with unequal treatment by the recommendation model.

Exploring potential biases towards blockbuster items in ranking-based recommendations,Yes,"we attempt to consider items that are both popular and highly-liked, which we refer to as blockbuster items, and to investigate whether the recommendation algorithms impose a considerable bias in favor of the blockbuster items in their ranking-based recommendations.

The Unfairness of Popularity Bias in Book Recommendation,Yes,"most state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in the book domain, and fail to meet users’ expectations with Niche and Diverse tastes despite having a larger profile size. bookcrossing",Advances in Bias and Fairness in Information Retrieval,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-09316-6_7,Mohammadmehdi NaghiaeiHossein A.

Popularity Bias in Collaborative Filtering-Based Multimedia Recommender Systems,Yes,we evaluate four collaborative filtering-based algorithms with respect to popularity bias on the item and the user level. bookcrossing,Advances in Bias and Fairness in Information Retrieval,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-09316-6_1,Dominik KowaldEmanuel Lacic,2022,Chapter

Privacy-Preserving Fair Item Ranking,Yes,This work is the first to advance research at the conjunction of producer (item) fairness and consumer (user) privacy in rankings by exploring the incorporation of privacy-preserving techniques. bookcrossing,Advances in Information Retrieval,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-28238-6_13,Jia Ao SunSikha PentyalaMartine De CockGolnoosh Farnadi,2023,Chapter
Towards Optimizing Ranking in Grid-Layout for Provider-Side Fairness,Yes,"Providing fair exposure to providers in such layouts is not well-studied. We seek to fill this gap by providing a grid-aware re-ranking algorithm to optimize layouts for provider-side fairness by adapting existing re-ranking techniques to grid-aware browsing models, and an analysis of the effect of grid-specific factors such as device size on the resulting fairness optimization.
