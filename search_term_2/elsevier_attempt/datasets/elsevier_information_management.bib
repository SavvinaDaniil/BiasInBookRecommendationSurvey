abstract = {The rapid development of information technology and the fast growth of Internet have facilitated an explosion of information which has accentuated the information overload problem. Recommender systems have emerged in response to this problem and helped users to find their interesting contents. With increasingly complicated social context, how to fulfill personalized needs better has become a new trend in personalized recommendation service studies. In order to alleviate the sparsity problem of recommender systems meanwhile increase their accuracy and diversity in complex contexts, we propose a novel recommendation method based on social network using matrix factorization technique. In this method, we cluster users and consider a variety of complex factors. The simulation results on two benchmark data sets and a real data set show that our method achieves superior performance to existing methods.}

abstract = {The use of pre-training is an emerging technique to enhance a neural model’s performance, which has been shown to be effective for many neural language models such as BERT. This technique has also been used to enhance the performance of recommender systems. In such recommender systems, pre-training models are used to learn a better initialisation for both users and items. However, recent existing pre-trained recommender systems tend to only incorporate the user interaction data at the pre-training stage, making it difficult to deliver good recommendations, especially when the interaction data is sparse. To alleviate this rcommon data sparsity issue, we propose to pre-train the recommendation model not only with the interaction data but also with other available information such as the social relations among users, thereby providing the recommender rsystem with a better initialisation compared with solely relying on the ruser interaction data. We propose a novel recommendation model, the Social-aware Gaussian Pre-trained model (SGP), which encodes the user social relations and interaction data at the pre-training stage in a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Afterwards, in the subsequent fine-tuning stage, our SGP model adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to factorise these pre-trained embeddings for further training, thereby benefiting the cold-start users from these pre-built social relations. Our extensive experiments on three public datasets show that, in comparison to 16 competitive baselines, our SGP model significantly outperforms the best baseline by upto 7.7% in terms of NDCG@10. In addition, we show that SGP permits to effectively alleviate the cold-start problem, especially when users newly register to the system through their friends’ suggestions.}

However, the experimental protocols adopted so far for evaluating a mitigation procedure were often fundamentally different (e.g., with respect to the fairness definitions, data sets, data splits, and evaluation metrics) and limited to a narrow set of perspectives (e.g., focusing on a single demographic attribute and/or not reporting any analysis on efficiency). This situation makes it challenging for scientists to consciously decide which mitigation procedure better suits their practical setting. In this paper, we investigated the properties a given mitigation procedure against consumer unfairness should be evaluated on, to provide a more holistic view on its effectiveness. We first identified eight technical properties and evaluated the extent to which existing mitigation procedures against consumer unfairness met these properties, qualitatively and quantitatively (when possible), on two public data sets. Then, we outlined the main trends and open issues emerged from our multi-dimensional analysis and provided key practical recommendations for future research.

The way that users provide feedback on items regarding their satisfaction varies among systems: in some systems, only explicit ratings can be entered; in other systems textual reviews are accepted; and in some systems, both feedback types are accommodated. Recommender systems can readily exploit explicit ratings in the rating prediction and recommendation formulation process, however textual reviews -which in the context of many social networks are in abundance and significantly outnumber numeric ratings- need to be converted to numeric ratings. While numerous approaches exist that calculate a user's rating based on the respective textual review, all such approaches may introduce errors, in the sense that the process of rating calculation based on textual reviews involves an uncertainty level, due to the characteristics of the human language, and therefore the calculated ratings may not accurately reflect the actual ratings that the corresponding user would enter. In this work (1) we examine the features of textual reviews, which affect the reliability of the review-to-rating conversion procedure, (2) we compute a confidence level for each rating, which reflects the uncertainty level for each conversion process, (3) we exploit this metric both in the users’ similarity computation and in the prediction formulation phases in recommender systems, by presenting a novel rating prediction algorithm and (4) we validate the accuracy of the presented algorithm in terms of (i) rating prediction accuracy, using widely-used recommender systems datasets and (ii) recommendations generated for social network user satisfaction and precision, where textual reviews are abundant.}

However, given the online reviews of attractions involve overabundant mixed and intangible dimensions, the widely-used unsupervised text mining could be incomplete or inaccurate. Furthermore, the existing literature typically restricted to the certain types of attractions within several tourist destinations and origins, can hardly guarantee comprehensive insights. To overcome these limitations, the study proposes a novel knowledge-graph-driven framework, involving the systematic construction as well as the thorough investigation and inference of a tourism-oriented knowledge graph (TKG). Following the ontology of domain expertise, 11,296,716 structured triplets of multifaceted knowledge about 1,174,034 tourists and 20,481 attractions within all 340 city-level destinations across China are extracted from multi-source text corpus by the transferring learning on pre-training language model with 43.64–50.65 % accuracy enhancement. In virtue of TKG, a comprehensive decision-support system can be established, which bifurcates into two distinct modes of knowledge application: symbolic query and distributed reasoning. Through the implementation of multiple spatiotemporal analyses via SPARQL queries on TKG, the distribution regularities of tourist preference, causal interpretations, and their effects on destination development can be progressively detected. Refining the distributed representations of objects by injecting abundant contextual knowledge from TKG can significantly enhance the downstream inferential tasks, such as tourist demand prediction and attraction competitive intelligence.}

abstract = {Latent factor models in collaborative filtering (CF) have been the state-of-the-art for over a decade and widely studied. Most models learn a representation of each user/item and calculate the inner product between them to perform a recommendation. Meanwhile, the inherent long-tailed data make the model training difficult and can cause popularity bias. Popularity bias mitigation has become one of the central themes of recent years. However, although the problems caused by popularity bias (e.g., the Matthew effect) should not be ignored, the popularity of an item implies its quality or trend. Popularity bias mitigation is rather undesirable for platforms and users who prefer popular items. In this study, we first focus on the inner product model and investigate the good property of the inner product for long-tailed data. The inner product is also employed in state-of-the-art CF models, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated empirically. We find that the inner product allows for modeling the long-tailed user–item interactions using the item vector magnitude while the representations remain identifiable. Based on this good property, we propose a method, DirectMag, that allows a platform and even the user to flexibly manipulate popularity bias. DirectMag determines the magnitude of the vectors directly after the training and can control the degree of popularity bias by adjusting only one parameter. In our experiments, we perform a detailed analysis that is not limited to the value of the average recommendation accuracy. We show that conventional methods inevitably suffer from trade-offs regarding the popularity of items, whereas our method is flexible enough to meet the diverse needs of a platform and the users.}

abstract = {Implicit recommendation refers to the users’ feedback on items derived from their interactions with items, i.e., clicks, and purchases. The methods in the implicit recommendation scenario usually regard all the adopted items as their favorites and indiscriminately assign a uniform confidence weight of their preference toward all the adopted items. In practice, however, a user’s preferences toward different items vary a lot. Treating them equally in existing implicit feedback recommender systems may limit the capacity of learning algorithms. To address this problem, we propose a novel Gaussian Personalized Recommendation OPTimization criterion (GPR-OPT), and our aim is to make the unknown preference confidence of users toward their adopted items in implicit feedback recommendation be learnable, so as to improve the accuracy of implicit recommender systems. In particular, we assume the user’s interests in items follow Gaussian distributions. By maximizing the posterior probability of items derived from the Gaussian distribution of user features, GPR-OPT is able to self-adaptively learn the confidence of users’ preferences from the implicit user–item interactions. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, i.e., Movielens 1M, Amazon Book, and Yelp, which show an average of 11.64% improvements over different kinds of collaborative filtering algorithms. GPR-OPT is a generic optimization criterion and can be easily integrated into most existing collaborative filtering recommendation models, leading to a great impact on implicit recommender systems.}

Most of the existing diversity optimization approaches re-rank the list of candidate items during a post-processing step. However, the diversity level of the candidate list strongly depends on the recommender system used. Hence, applying the same post-processing diversification strategy may not be as effective for different recommendation approaches. Moreover, individual users’ diversity needs are usually ignored in the diversification post-processing. This article aims at providing an in-depth analysis of the diversity performances of different recommender systems. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to systematically compare diversity performances of the main types of recommendation models using benchmark datasets in different domains (movie, anime and book). Semantics related to items may be considered a key factor in measuring diversity within recommender systems. In this study, we leverage support from the knowledge engineering domain and take advantage of resources such as Linked Data and knowledge graphs, to assert the diversity of recommendations. We also propose a variant of the classic diversification post-processing objective that allows to take into account specific users’ diversity needs. We measure the adequacy between the diversity levels a recommender system suggests to its users and those of users’ profiles with the R2 coefficient of determination. Our study indicates that: (1) none of the tested recommender systems, even the most recent ones, provides items with levels of diversity that suit user profiles (R2<0.2); (2) the classic post-processing diversification approach may lead to over-diversification compared to users’ diversity needs and (3) the diversity adjustment that accounts for user profiles has more benefits (greater R2 and smaller accuracy loss).

In this paper, we first propose an attentional attribute and interaction method used to model the semantic embeddings of users and items. We then construct a type-specific matrix to exploit heterogeneous type-specific information to learn user and item representations. The incorporated heterogeneous type information helps capture a user’s latent features that solve the sparsity problem of user–item interactions for the recommender systems. Further, the rating relationship of the nodes is predicted through the translation mechanism based on user and items’ type-specific representations. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model over several state-of-the-art methods and show the visual interpretability for rating behaviors in e-commerce recommender systems.}

Moreover, most modern recommendation techniques are characterized as black-box systems. Given a lack of understanding of the dataset characteristics and insufficient diversity of represented individuals, such approaches inevitably lead to amplifying hidden data biases and existing disparities. In this research, we address this problem by proposing a novel approach to detecting and describing potentially discriminated user groups for a given recommendation algorithm. We propose a Bias-Aware Hierarchical Clustering algorithm that identifies user clusters based on latent embeddings constructed by a black-box recommender to identify users whose needs are not met by the given recommendation method. Next, a post-hoc explainer model is applied to reveal the most important descriptive features that characterize these user segments. Our method is model-agnostic and does not require any a priori information about existing disparities and sensitive attributes. An experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets from different domains shows that, compared with other clustering methods and arbitrarily selected user groups, our method is capable of identifying underperforming segments for different recommendation algorithms, and detect more severe disparities.}

abstract = {Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has recently attracted significant attention in the field of recommender systems. However, many GCL methods aim to enhance recommendation accuracy by employing dense matrix operations and frequent manipulation of graph structures to generate contrast views, leading to substantial computational resource consumption. While simpler GCL methods have lower computational costs, they fail to fully exploit collaborative filtering information, leading to reduced accuracy. On the other hand, more complex adaptive methods achieve higher accuracy but at the expense of significantly greater computational cost. Consequently, there exists a considerable gap in accuracy between these lightweight models and the more complex GCL methods focused on high accuracy. To address this issue and achieve high predictive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost, we propose a novel method that incorporates attention-wise graph reconstruction with message masking and cross-view interaction for contrastive learning. The attention-wise graph reconstruction with message masking preserves the structural and semantic information of the graph while mitigating the overfitting problem. Linear attention ensures that the algorithm’s complexity remains low. Furthermore, the cross-view interaction is capable of capturing more high-quality latent features. Our results, validated on four datasets, demonstrate that the proposed method maintains a lightweight computational cost and significantly outperforms the baseline methods in recommendation accuracy.}

We focus on a suite of DCs that capture properties about the structure of the user–item interaction matrix, the rating frequency, item properties, or the distribution of rating values. Experimental validation of the proposed system involved large-scale experiments by performing 23,400 recommendation simulations on three real-world datasets in the movie (ML-100K and ML-1M) and book domains (BookCrossing). The validation results show that the investigated DCs in some cases can have up to 90% of explanatory power – on several variations of classical CF algorithms –, while they can explain – in the best case – about 40% of fairness results (measured according to user gender and age sensitive attributes).

For considering the high-order interactions, CHCLA models user–item interaction through a graph convolutional network and user/item attribute information through hypergraph convolutional networks, learning user and item representations in two distinct ways. Furthermore, for the problem of sparse and noisy supervised signals, CHCLA uses self-supervised cross-view contrastive learning by generating self-augmented contrastive views between user–item interaction graph and user/item attribute interaction hypergraph to improve the robustness of graph representations learning. CHCLA not only captures user behavior representations but also accommodates inherent user and item attribute preferences. Extensive experiments illustrate that CHCLA performs better than advanced approaches, the NDCG@10 of CHCLA on MovieLens, Book-crossing and Taobao datasets is improved by 1.29%, 2.11% and 8.09% respectively, offering a promising avenue for further research and advancement in recommender systems.}

Indeed, the system offers a possibility to the items of those providers of being reached and consumed by the end-users. Hence, according to how recommendation lists are shaped, the experience of under-recommended providers in online platforms can be affected. To study this phenomenon, we focus on movie and book recommendation and enrich two datasets with the continent of production of an item. We use this data to characterize imbalances in the distribution of the user–item observations and regarding where items are produced (geographic imbalance). To assess if recommender systems generate a disparate impact and (dis)advantage a group, we divide items into groups, based on their continent of production, and characterize how represented is each group in the data. Then, we run state-of-the-art recommender systems and measure the visibility and exposure given to each group. We observe disparities that favor the most represented groups. We overcome these phenomena by introducing equity with a re-ranking approach that regulates the share of recommendations given to the items produced in a continent (visibility) and the positions in which items are ranked in the recommendation list (exposure), with a negligible loss in effectiveness, thus controlling fairness of providers coming from different continents. A comparison with the state of the art shows that our approach can provide more equity for providers, both in terms of visibility and of exposure.}

At the same time, in traditional recommender systems, in order to improve their performance in these sparse situations, different techniques have been proposed mainly by augmenting and aggregating the data available in different domains. In this paper, we address the problem of venue recommendation from a novel perspective: we propose two strategies to select a set of candidate cities in order to use their information when performing recommendations for the users in a specific (target) city. In this context, we categorize users into two different groups (tourists and locals) according to their movement patterns and analyze the potential biases in the recommendations received by each of these groups. We provide an experimental comparison of several recommendation algorithms in a temporal split, where we analyze two strategies to select cities and augment the available data: based on the number of interactions and based on the distance with respect to the target city. Our results show that, in general, extending the available data by proximity increases the performance of the majority of the tested recommenders in terms of relevance and coverage, with almost no change in novelty and diversity. We have found that those users belonging to the tourist group tend to obtain better results in terms of relevance. Furthermore, in general, tourists consistently exhibit different performance by some families of recommenders for other evaluation dimensions, evidencing a popularity bias in user behavior and raising potential fairness issues regarding the quality of the received recommendations. We investigate these aspects and provide methods to better understand the problem. We expect these results could provide readers with an overall picture of what can be achieved in a real-world environment.}
