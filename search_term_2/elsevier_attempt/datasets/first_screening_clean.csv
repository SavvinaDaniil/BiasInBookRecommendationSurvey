Flexibly manipulating popularity bias for tackling trade-offs in recommendation,Yes,"We show that conventional methods inevitably suffer from trade-offs regarding the popularity of items, whereas our method is flexible enough to meet the diverse needs of a platform and the users. amazonbooks","['Hiroki Okamura', 'Keisuke Maeda', 'Ren Togo', 'Takahiro Ogawa', 'Miki Haseyama']",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457323003436,"Latent factor models in collaborative filtering (CF) have been the state-of-the-art for over a decade and widely studied. Most models learn a representation of each user/item and calculate the inner product between them to perform a recommendation. Meanwhile, the inherent long-tailed data make the model training difficult and can cause popularity bias. Popularity bias mitigation has become one of the central themes of recent years. However, although the problems caused by popularity bias (e.g., the Matthew effect) should not be ignored, the popularity of an item implies its quality or trend. Popularity bias mitigation is rather undesirable for platforms and users who prefer popular items. In this study, we first focus on the inner product model and investigate the good property of the inner product for long-tailed data. The inner product is also employed in state-of-the-art CF models, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated empirically. We find that the inner product allows for modeling the long-tailed user–item interactions using the item vector magnitude while the representations remain identifiable. Based on this good property, we propose a method, DirectMag, that allows a platform and even the user to flexibly manipulate popularity bias. DirectMag determines the magnitude of the vectors directly after the training and can control the degree of popularity bias by adjusting only one parameter. In our experiments, we perform a detailed analysis that is not limited to the value of the average recommendation accuracy. We show that conventional methods inevitably suffer from trade-offs regarding the popularity of items, whereas our method is flexible enough to meet the diverse needs of a platform and the users.",Information Processing & Management,2024
Is diversity optimization always suitable? Toward a better understanding of diversity within recommendation approaches,Yes,This article aims at providing an in-depth analysis of the diversity performances of different recommender systems. librarything,"['Yu Du', 'Sylvie Ranwez', 'Nicolas Sutton-Charani', 'Vincent Ranwez']",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457321002053,"The diversity of the item list suggested by recommender systems has been proven to impact user satisfaction significantly. Most of the existing diversity optimization approaches re-rank the list of candidate items during a post-processing step. However, the diversity level of the candidate list strongly depends on the recommender system used. Hence, applying the same post-processing diversification strategy may not be as effective for different recommendation approaches. Moreover, individual users’ diversity needs are usually ignored in the diversification post-processing. This article aims at providing an in-depth analysis of the diversity performances of different recommender systems. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to systematically compare diversity performances of the main types of recommendation models using benchmark datasets in different domains (movie, anime and book). Semantics related to items may be considered a key factor in measuring diversity within recommender systems. In this study, we leverage support from the knowledge engineering domain and take advantage of resources such as Linked Data and knowledge graphs, to assert the diversity of recommendations. We also propose a variant of the classic diversification post-processing objective that allows to take into account specific users’ diversity needs. We measure the adequacy between the diversity levels a recommender system suggests to its users and those of users’ profiles with the R2 coefficient of determination. Our study indicates that: (1) none of the tested recommender systems, even the most recent ones, provides items with levels of diversity that suit user profiles (R2<0.2); (2) the classic post-processing diversification approach may lead to over-diversification compared to users’ diversity needs and (3) the diversity adjustment that accounts for user profiles has more benefits (greater R2 and smaller accuracy loss). All the source code and datasets used in our study are available to ensure the reproductibility of the study.",Information Processing & Management,2021
Bias-Aware Hierarchical Clustering for detecting the discriminated groups of users in recommendation systems,Yes,Bias-Aware Hierarchical Clustering algorithm that identifies user clusters based on latent embeddings constructed by a black-box recommender to identify users whose needs are not met by the given recommendation method. bookcrossing,"['Joanna Misztal-Radecka', 'Bipin Indurkhya']",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457321000285,"One challenge for the modern recommendation systems is the Tyranny of Majority — the generated recommendations are often optimized for the mainstream trends so that the minority preference groups remain discriminated. Moreover, most modern recommendation techniques are characterized as black-box systems. Given a lack of understanding of the dataset characteristics and insufficient diversity of represented individuals, such approaches inevitably lead to amplifying hidden data biases and existing disparities. In this research, we address this problem by proposing a novel approach to detecting and describing potentially discriminated user groups for a given recommendation algorithm. We propose a Bias-Aware Hierarchical Clustering algorithm that identifies user clusters based on latent embeddings constructed by a black-box recommender to identify users whose needs are not met by the given recommendation method. Next, a post-hoc explainer model is applied to reveal the most important descriptive features that characterize these user segments. Our method is model-agnostic and does not require any a priori information about existing disparities and sensitive attributes. An experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets from different domains shows that, compared with other clustering methods and arbitrarily selected user groups, our method is capable of identifying underperforming segments for different recommendation algorithms, and detect more severe disparities.",Information Processing & Management,2021
Explaining recommender systems fairness and accuracy through the lens of data characteristics,Yes,This work provides a systematic study on the impact of broadly chosen data characteristics (DCs) of recommender systems. This is applied to the accuracy and fairness of several variations of CF recommendation models. bookcrossing,"['Yashar Deldjoo', 'Alejandro Bellogin', 'Tommaso {Di Noia}']",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457321001503,"The impact of data characteristics on the performance of classical recommender systems has been recently investigated and produced fruitful results about the relationship they have with recommendation accuracy. This work provides a systematic study on the impact of broadly chosen data characteristics (DCs) of recommender systems. This is applied to the accuracy and fairness of several variations of CF recommendation models. We focus on a suite of DCs that capture properties about the structure of the user–item interaction matrix, the rating frequency, item properties, or the distribution of rating values. Experimental validation of the proposed system involved large-scale experiments by performing 23,400 recommendation simulations on three real-world datasets in the movie (ML-100K and ML-1M) and book domains (BookCrossing). The validation results show that the investigated DCs in some cases can have up to 90% of explanatory power – on several variations of classical CF algorithms –, while they can explain – in the best case – about 40% of fairness results (measured according to user gender and age sensitive attributes). Therefore, this work evidences that it is more difficult to explain variations in performance when dealing with fairness dimension than accuracy.",Information Processing & Management,2021
Provider fairness across continents in collaborative recommender systems,Yes,we focus on movie and book recommendation and enrich two datasets with the continent of production of an item. We use this data to characterize imbalances in the distribution of the user–item observations and regarding where items are produced (geographic imbalance). bookcrossing,"['Elizabeth Gómez', 'Ludovico Boratto', 'Maria Salamó']",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645732100203X,"When a recommender system suggests items to the end-users, it gives a certain exposure to the providers behind the recommended items. Indeed, the system offers a possibility to the items of those providers of being reached and consumed by the end-users. Hence, according to how recommendation lists are shaped, the experience of under-recommended providers in online platforms can be affected. To study this phenomenon, we focus on movie and book recommendation and enrich two datasets with the continent of production of an item. We use this data to characterize imbalances in the distribution of the user–item observations and regarding where items are produced (geographic imbalance). To assess if recommender systems generate a disparate impact and (dis)advantage a group, we divide items into groups, based on their continent of production, and characterize how represented is each group in the data. Then, we run state-of-the-art recommender systems and measure the visibility and exposure given to each group. We observe disparities that favor the most represented groups. We overcome these phenomena by introducing equity with a re-ranking approach that regulates the share of recommendations given to the items produced in a continent (visibility) and the positions in which items are ranked in the recommendation list (exposure), with a negligible loss in effectiveness, thus controlling fairness of providers coming from different continents. A comparison with the state of the art shows that our approach can provide more equity for providers, both in terms of visibility and of exposure.",Information Processing & Management,2022
