On the instability of embeddings for recommender systems: the case of matrix factorization,"by simply changing the initial values assigned to the latent factors, the same MF method generates very different embeddings of items and users, and we highlight that this effect is stronger for less popular items.",Yes,"['Giovanni Gabbolini', ""Edoardo D'Amico"", 'Cesare Bernardis', 'Paolo Cremonesi']",https://doi.org/10.1145/3412841.3442011,"Most state-of-the-art top-N collaborative recommender systems work by learning embeddings to jointly represent users and items. Learned embeddings are considered to be effective to solve a variety of tasks. Among others, providing and explaining recommendations. In this paper we question the reliability of the embeddings learned by Matrix Factorization (MF). We empirically demonstrate that, by simply changing the initial values assigned to the latent factors, the same MF method generates very different embeddings of items and users, and we highlight that this effect is stronger for less popular items. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a generalization of MF, called Nearest Neighbors Matrix Factorization (NNMF). The new method propagates the information about items and users to their neighbors, speeding up the training procedure and extending the amount of information that supports recommendations and representations. We describe the NNMF variants of three common MF approaches, and with extensive experiments on five different datasets we show that they strongly mitigate the instability issues of the original MF versions and they improve the accuracy of recommendations on the long-tail.",Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2021,Research
"Understanding Assimilation-contrast Effects in Online Rating Systems: Modelling, Debiasing, and Applications",,Yes,"['Xiaoying Zhang', 'Hong Xie', 'Junzhou Zhao', 'John Lui']",https://doi.org/10.1145/3362651,"“Unbiasedness,” which is an important property to ensure that users’ ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations of products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations in online rating systems. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to “discover” historical distortions in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the “debiasing operations” are our main objective. Using 42M real customer ratings, we first show that users either “assimilate” or “contrast” to historical ratings under different scenarios, which can be further explained by a well-known psychological argument: the “Assimilate-Contrast” theory. This motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the “first” model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modelling perspective, which perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects observed in experiments. Moreover, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings and characterizing relationships in ratings. It also contributes to better recommendations, wiser consumer purchase decisions, and deeper understanding of historical distortions in both honest rating and misbehaving rating settings.",missing,2019,Research
