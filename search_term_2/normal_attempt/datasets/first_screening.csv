This study therefore examines the impacts of key factors from theories of information systems (IS) success and sense of community (SOC) on users' continuance intention in the social cataloging context. Data collected from an online survey of 323 social cataloging users provide empirical support for the research model. The findings indicate that both information quality (IQ) and system quality (SQ) are significant predictors of satisfaction and SOC, which in turn lead to users' intentions to continue using these sites. In addition, SOC was found to affect continuance intention not only directly, but also indirectly through satisfaction. Theoretically, this study draws attention to a largely unexplored but essential area of research in the social cataloging literature and provides a fundamental basis to understand the determinants of continued social cataloging usage. From a managerial perspective, the findings suggest that social cataloging service providers should constantly focus their efforts on the quality control of their contents and system, and the enhancement of SOC among their users. ¬© 2015 ASIS&T",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995495207&doi=10.1002%2fasi.23556&partnerID=40&md5=c1fed9640c2e488d6e5139a3b0a30a2d
Scopus,,Sparsity reduction technique using grouping method for matrix factorization in differentially private recommendation systems,Kim T.; Jung K.; Park S.,IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems,2020.0,"Web service users are overwhelmed by the amount of information presented to them and have difficulties in finding the information that they need. Therefore, a recommendation system that predicts users' taste is an essential factor for the success of businesses. However, recommendation systems require users' personal information and can thus lead to serious privacy violations. To solve this problem, many research has been conducted about protecting personal information in recommendation systems and implementing differential privacy, a privacy protection technique that inserts noise into the original data. However, previous studies did not examine the following factors in applying differential privacy to recommendation systems. First, they did not consider the sparsity of user rating information. The total number of items is much more than the number of user-rated items. Therefore, a rating matrix created for users and items will be very sparse. This characteristic renders the identification of user patterns in rating matrixes difficult. Therefore, the sparsity issue should be considered in the application of differential privacy to recommendation systems. Second, previous studies focused on protecting user rating information but did not aim to protect the lists of user-rated items. Recommendation systems should protect these item lists because they also disclose user preferences. In this study, we propose a differentially private recommendation scheme that bases on a grouping method to solve the sparsity issue and to protect user-rated item lists and user rating information. The proposed technique shows better performance and privacy protection on actual movie rating data in comparison with an existing technique. ¬© 2020 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE.

This study aimed to explore the impact of e-marketing factors for agricultural products on the sustainable consumer behaviour. The technology acceptance model (TAM) and the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model were used to investigate the factors that trigger long-term behavioural changes towards more sustainable consumer behaviour. Trust and continuance intention (CI) constitute sustainable consumer behaviours. The survey-based data were collected from 172 farmers in and around the Al-Baha province of Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal that, out of the six factors, social influence (SI), hedonic motives (HM), and perceived risk (PR) had a significant impact on trust whereas the perceived usefulness (PU), information quality (IQ), and the perceived ease of use (PEOU) had an insignificant impact on trust. Trust appears to had a substantial positive impact on the development of CI. Furthermore, the significant moderation of age and the insignificant moderation of education are observed among trust‚ÄìCI relationship. Therefore, policymakers should concentrate on the factors such as SI and decrease the factors that are related to the PR in order to achieve a higher level of trust.

Addressing this challenge, we envision a recommendation simulator, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in human-level intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose Agent4Rec, a user simulator in recommendation, leveraging LLM-empowered generative agents equipped with user profile, memory, and actions modules specifically tailored for the recommender system. In particular, these agents' profile modules are initialized using real-world datasets (e.g., MovieLens, Steam, Amazon-Book), capturing users' unique tastes and social traits; memory modules log both factual and emotional memories and are integrated with an emotion-driven reflection mechanism; action modules support a wide variety of behaviors, spanning both taste-driven and emotion-driven actions. Each agent interacts with personalized recommender models in a page-by-page manner, relying on a pre-implemented collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithm. We delve into both the capabilities and limitations of Agent4Rec, aiming to explore an essential research question: ""To what extent can LLM-empowered generative agents faithfully simulate the behavior of real, autonomous humans in recommender systems?""Extensive and multi-faceted evaluations of Agent4Rec highlight both the alignment and deviation between agents and user-personalized preferences.

Tag genome has received considerable attention in recommender systems research and has been used in a wide variety of studies, from investigating the effects of recommender systems on users to generating ideas for movies that appeal to certain user groups. In this paper, we present tag genome for books, a dataset containing book-Tag relevance scores, where a significant number of tags overlap with those from tag genome for movies. To generate our dataset, we designed a survey based on popular books and tags from the Goodreads dataset. In our survey, we asked users to provide ratings for how well tags applied to books. We generated book-Tag relevance scores based on user ratings along with features from the Goodreads dataset.

In the last two decades, user-generated book reviews on social media have opened up unprecedented research possibilities for humanities and social sciences (HSS) scholars who are interested in book reception. However, limitations and gaps have emerged from existing DH research which utilize social media data for answering HSS questions. To shed light on the under-investigated features of user-generated book reviews and the challenges they might pose to scholarly research, we conducted three exemplar cases studies: (1) a longitudinal analysis for profiling the temporal changes of ratings and popularity of 552 books across ten years; (2) a cross-cultural comparison of book ratings of the same 538 books across two platforms; and, (3) a classification experiment on 20,000 sponsored and non-sponsored books reviews. Correspondingly, our research reveals the real-world complexities and under-investigated features of user-generated book reviews in three dimensions: The transience of book ratings and popularity (temporal dimension), the cross-cultural differences in reading interests and book reception (cultural dimension), and the user power dynamics behind the publicly accessible reviews (""political"" dimension). Our case studies also demonstrate the challenges posed by user-generated book reviews' real-world complexities to their scholarly usage and propose solutions to these challenges.

Scopus,,Causal Inference for Knowledge Graph Based Recommendation,Wei Y.; Wang X.; Nie L.; Li S.; Wang D.; Chua T.-S.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023.0,"Knowledge Graph (KG), as a side-information, tends to be utilized to supplement the collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation model. By mapping items with the entities in KGs, prior studies mostly extract the knowledge information from the KGs and inject it into the representations of users and items. Despite their remarkable performance, they fail to model the user preference on attribute in the KG, since they ignore that (1) the structure information of KG may hinder the user preference learning, and (2) the user's interacted attributes will result in the bias issue on the similarity scores. With the help of causality tools, we construct the causal-effect relation between the variables in KG-based recommendation and identify the reasons causing the mentioned challenges. Accordingly, we develop a new framework, termed Knowledge Graph-based Causal Recommendation (KGCR), which implements the deconfounded user preference learning and adopts counterfactual inference to eliminate bias in the similarity scoring. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed model on three datasets, including Amazon-book, LastFM, and Yelp2018 datasets. By conducting extensive experiments on the datasets, we demonstrate that KGCR outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, such as KGNN-LS (Wang et al., 2019), KGAT (Wang et al., 2019) and KGIN (Wang et al., 2021). ¬© 1989-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146234200&doi=10.1109%2fTKDE.2022.3231352&partnerID=40&md5=f2a7668cd993f877005cdc3415498456

Comparing thousands of reader reviews on Goodreads.com of 64 English-language books that either won or were short-listed for prestigious book awards between 2007 and 2011, we find that prizewinning books tend to attract more readers following the announcement of an award and that readers' ratings of award-winning books tend to decline more precipitously following the announcement of an award relative to books that were named as finalists but did not win. We explain this surprising result, focusing on two mechanisms whereby signals of quality that tend to promote adoption can subsequently have a negative impact on evaluation. First, we propose that the audience evaluating a high-status actor or object tends to shift as a result of a public status shock, like an award, increasing in number but also in diverse tastes. We outline how this shift might translate into less favorable evaluations of quality. Second, we show that the increase in popularity that tends to follow a status shock is off-putting to some, also resulting in more negative evaluations. We show that our proposed mechanisms together explain the negative effect of status on evaluations in the context of the literary world. ¬© The Author(s) 2014.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893871013&doi=10.1177%2f0001839214523602&partnerID=40&md5=490f67a4a07a781f64a4e62069415ab4

Till this end, we have created an iterative and incremental process of designing and testing the UI components of Resume Matching.

User studies represent a viable alternative to online and offline evaluation schemes, but despite their numerous benefits, they are only rarely used. One of the main reasons behind this fact is that preparing a user study from scratch involves a lot of extra work on top of a simple algorithm proposal. To simplify this task, we propose EasyStudy, a modular framework built on the credo ""Make simple things fast and hard things possible"". It features ready-to-use datasets, preference elicitation methods, incrementally tuned baseline algorithms, study flow plugins, and evaluation metrics. As a result, a simple study comparing several RS can be deployed with just a few clicks, while more complex study designs can still benefit from a range of reusable components, such as preference elicitation. Overall, EasyStudy dramatically decreases the gap between the laboriousness of offline evaluation vs. user studies and, therefore, may contribute towards the more reliable and insightful user-centric evaluation of next-generation RS.

The model consists of user and item features learning. Based on the history of user interaction, the user feature learning applies the preference propagation and cross compression to embedded propagation to obtain user representation. The item feature learningapplies graph convolutional network to aggregating the high-order neighborhood information of each item on the item knowledge graph, and uses the bias to distinguish the importance of the neighbors to obtain the item representation. Finally, the predicted values are calculated using user and item feature representation, and the interaction probability between user and item is calculated by inner product operation between vectors. On two public datasets, comparative experiments are conducted using five baseline methods. For the Book-Crossing dataset, the AUC, ACC and F1 values of KRGCN are respectively increased by 4.43% to 11.96%, 1.68% to 10.82% and 1.90% to 12.78%.

In this paper, we investigate a potential issue of such collaborative-filtering based multimedia recommender systems, namely popularity bias that leads to the underrepresentation of unpopular items in the recommendation lists. Therefore, we study four multimedia datasets, i.e., Last.fm, MovieLens, BookCrossing and MyAnimeList, that we each split into three user groups differing in their inclination to popularity, i.e., LowPop, MedPop and HighPop. Using these user groups, we evaluate four collaborative filtering-based algorithms with respect to popularity bias on the item and the user level. Our findings are three-fold: firstly, we show that users with little interest into popular items tend to have large user profiles and thus, are important data sources for multimedia recommender systems. Secondly, we find that popular items are recommended more frequently than unpopular ones. Thirdly, we find that users with little interest into popular items receive significantly worse recommendations than users with medium or high interest into popularity. ¬© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134293596&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-09316-6_1&partnerID=40&md5=baef6a5cd86f22b4f540f4261433f132
Scopus,,Notes toward a politics of personalization,Murphy M.S.,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2011.0,"A recommender system is an information organization tool which extracts knowledge of individual users of a specific (online) resource based on their activity within that domain, and uses this knowledge to generate for them individual recommendations. These recommendations are made based on the broad assumption that people who have agreed on some things in the past will likely agree on things in the future. [1] Because these systems classify content based on how it is engaged with by previous users, they have emerged as an effective (and profitable) way to organize content on the web, the web itself being resistant, almost by its very nature, to the imposition of top-down, ontological classificatory control. [2] This paper interrogates some of the assumptions and biases involved in the personalized organization and presentation of digital media content, in an effort to devise a more critical analysis of the economic, technical, and social forces that contribute to the growing popularity of the personalized recommender systems. It pays particular attention to how personalized content filtering finds expression in the recommendation engines of taste-coordinating websites like Amazon and Pandora, in the self-organization of information through social classification sites like LibraryThing and Delicious, in the adaptive capabilities of next generation search engines (what Michael Zimmer refers to as ""Search 2.0""), and finally within locational media software like FourSquare. Discussion of these recommender systems will refer to their mechanics as well as their accompanying rhetoric, which often associates the personalized delivery of content with a more empowered individual user. Promises of individual empowerment attached to emerging expressions of personalized media are generally made in opposition to the broadcast media model of the mass market. The concluding section of this paper will examine the rhetoric of these promises in a discussion that considers such novel adaptations of content production and delivery as a market response to current media configurations. These adaptations, it will be argued, serve in large part to define differences to be ""commercially exploited.""

It addresses, on the one hand, the data confidentiality during the training, by exploring federated learning and trusted authority mechanisms. On the other hand, it deals with data quantity, and quality by exploring both transformers and consumer clustering. The process starts by clustering the consumers into similar clusters using contrastive learning and k-means algorithm. The local model of each consumer is trained on the local data. The local models of the consumers with the clustering information are then sent to the server, where integrity verification is performed by a trusted authority. Instead of traditional federated learning solutions, two kinds of aggregation are performed. The first one is the aggregation of all models of the consumers to derive the global model. The second one is the aggregation of the models of each cluster to derive a local model of similar consumers. Both models are sent to the consumers, where each consumer decides which appropriate model might be used for personal recommendation. Robust experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the applicability of the method using MovieLens-1M, and Amazon-book.

Scopus,,Designing warning messages for detecting biased online product recommendations: An empirical investigation,Xiao B.; Benbasat I.,Information Systems Research,2015.0,"The increasing adoption of product recommendation agents (PRAs) by e-commerce merchants makes it an important area of study for information systems researchers. PRAs are a type of Web personalization technology that provides individual consumers with product recommendations based on their product-related needs and preferences expressed explicitly or implicitly. Whereas extant research mainly assumes that such recommendation technologies are designed to benefit consumers and focuses on the positive impact of PRAs on consumers' decision quality and decision effort, this study represents an early effort to examine PRAs that are designed to produce their recommendations on the basis of benefiting e-commerce merchants (rather than benefiting consumers) and to investigate how the availability and the design of warning messages (a potential detection support mechanism) can enhance consumers' performance in detecting such biased PRAs. Drawing on signal detection theory, the literature on warning messages, and the literature on message framing, we identified two content design characteristics of warning messages-the inclusion of risk-handling advice and the framing of risk-handling advice-and investigated how they influence consumers' detection performance. The results of an online experiment reveal that a simple warning message without accompanying advice on how to detect bias is a double-edged sword, because it increases correct detection of biased PRAs (hits) at the cost of increased incorrect detection (false alarms). By contrast, including in warning messages risk-handling advice about how to check for bias (particularly when the advice is framed to emphasize the loss from not following the advice) increases correct detection and, more importantly, also decreases incorrect detection. The patterns of findings are in line with the predictions of signal detection theory. With an enriched understanding of how the availability and the content design of warning messages can assist consumers in the context of PRA-assisted online shopping, the results of this study serve as a basis for future theoretical development and yield valuable insights that can guide practice and the design of effective warning messages. ¬© 2015 INFORMS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957707933&doi=10.1287%2fisre.2015.0592&partnerID=40&md5=8452dfa55e817df437244d19a46207bf

However, existing contrast learning-based KGR models still have the following limitations. First, existing methods failed to suppress the interference information of unnecessary neighbouring nodes in the knowledge graph because graph convolution is used to directly aggregate all neighbouring nodes; Second, focusing only on the global information would lead to ignoring the fine-grained local features, causing over-smooth issues. In this work, a Knowledge-aware Recommender System with Cross-Views Contrastive Learning (KRSCCL) is proposed to address the aforementioned issues. In the KRSCCL, a relational graph attention network is proposed to construct a global view, including user, item and entity nodes. A lightweight graph convolutional network is designed to construct a local view, including user and item nodes, in which local features are emphasized to effectively mitigate the over-smooth problem. Finally, the contrastive learning mechanism is performed between intra- and inter-graph node pairs of the two views to fully extract KG signals and further optimize the user and item representations. Experimental results on three public datasets from different domains demonstrate that the proposed KRSCCL achieves expected performance improvement on all the three datasets over selective baselines, F1 score improvement on Movielens-1M, Last.FM and Book-crossing are 2.0%, 0.3% and 5.1%, respectively.

The recently proposed Transformer-based models have proved superior in the sequential recommendation, modeling temporal dynamics globally via the remarkable self-attention mechanism. However, all equivalent item-item interactions in original self-attention are cumbersome, failing to capture the drifting of users' local preferences, which contain abundant short-term patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable convolutional self-attention, which efficiently captures both short- and long-term patterns with a progressive attention distribution. Specifically, a down-sampling convolution module is proposed to segment the overall long behavior sequence into a series of local subsequences. Accordingly, the segments are interacted with each item in the self-attention layer to produce locality-aware contextual representations, during which the quadratic complexity in original self-attention is reduced to nearly linear complexity. Moreover, to further enhance the robust feature learning in the context of Transformers, an unsymmetrical positional encoding strategy is carefully designed.

In addition, user‚Äôs interest is easily affected by short-term environment and mood. This paper proposes a recommendation model that is a multi-task feature learning approach for knowledge graph and short-term preferences enhanced recommendation (MKASR) in response to the above two points. Firstly, the RippleNet algorithm is used to extract the relationship pairs between the user and the knowledge graph entity, and then these relationship pairs are stored in the form of knowledge graph triples for participating in training. The bidirectional GRU (gate recurrent unit) network based on the attention mechanism is adopted from the user‚Äôs recent interaction sequence of items to extract the user‚Äôs short-term preferences. Secondly, this paper uses the multi-task learning method to train the knowledge graph learning module and the recommendation module.

Relevant research has long focused on refining and improving these models to produce better (more effective) recommendations, and has converged on a methodology to predict their effectiveness on target datasets by evaluating them on random samples of the latter. However, predicting the efficiency of the solutions - especially with regard to their time- and resource-hungry training phase, whose requirements dwarf those of the prediction/recommendation phase - has received little to no attention in the literature. This article addresses this gap for a number of representative and highly popular CF models, including algorithms based on matrix factorization, k-nearest neighbors, co-clustering, and slope one schemes. To this end, we first study the computational complexity of the training phase of said CF models and derive time and space complexity equations. Then, using characteristics of the input and the aforementioned equations, we contribute a methodology for predicting the processing time and memory usage of their training phase. Our contributions further include an adaptive sampling strategy, to address the tradeoff between resource usage costs and prediction accuracy, and a framework that quantifies both the efficiency and effectiveness of CF.

This algorithm explores the internal connections of knowledge graphs to discover the potential relationship between users and items. On the user side, this paper proposes a method of aggregating user neighbor information. In the relational space of the knowledge graph, the knowledge graph is used to spread and extract the user s potential interest, and iteratively inject the potential interest into the user characteristics with attention bias to generate user embedding representation vector. At the item side, the user vector that aggregates the users neighbor information is sent to the KGCN (knowledge graph convolutional networks) model, and when the polymer product and its neighbor information are used, a new aggregation method is used to generate the item embedding representation. Finally, the obtained vector is sent to train. Through the inner product operation of the vector and normalization, the association score between the user and the item is obtained. Then the training is carried out in the training set to optimize the parameters. Comparative experiments are conducted on two public datasets.

Scopus,,GNNCL: A Graph Neural Network Recommendation Model Based on Contrastive Learning,Chen J.; Zhou J.; Ma L.,Neural Processing Letters,2024.0,"In the field of recommendation algorithms, the representation learning for users and items has evolved from using single IDs or historical interactions to utilizing higher-order neighbors. This can be achieved by modeling the user‚Äìitem interaction graph to capture user preferences for items. Despite the promising results achieved by these algorithms, they still suffer from the issue of data sparsity. In order to mitigate the impact of data sparsity, contrastive learning has been adopted in graph collaborative filtering to enhance performance. However, current recommendation algorithms using contrastive learning yield uneven representations after data augmentation and do not consider the potential relationships among users (or items). To address these challenges, we propose a graph neural network-based recommendation model that integrates contrastive learning (GNNCL). This model combines data augmentation with added noise and the exploration of semantic neighbors for nodes. For the structural neighbors on the interaction graph, we introduce a novel and straightforward contrastive learning approach, abandoning previous graph augmentation methods, and introducing uniform noise into the embedding space to create contrastive views. To unearth potential semantic neighbor relationships in the semantic space, we assume that users with similar representations possess semantic neighbor relationships and merge these semantic neighbors into the prototype contrastive learning.

Design ‚Äì Data analysis of publicly available book sales rankings and reader ratings. Setting ‚Äì The internet. Subjects ‚Äì 192 New York Times hardcover fiction best seller titles from 2018, and 1,367 Goodreads ratings posted in 2018. Methods ‚Äì Data were collected using Application Programming Interfaces. The researchers retrieved weekly hardcover fiction best seller rankings published by the New York Times in 2018 in CSV file format. All 52 files, each containing bibliographic data for 15 hardcover fiction titles, were combined and duplicate titles removed, resulting in 192 unique best seller titles. The researchers retrieved reader ratings of the 192 best seller titles from Goodreads. The ratings were limited to those posted in 2018 by the top Goodreads reviewers. A Bayes estimator produced a list of the top ten highest rated New York Times best sellers. The researchers built the recommender system using Python and employed several content-based and collaborative filtering recommender techniques (e.g., cosine similarity, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and matrix factorization algorithms) to identify novels similar to the highest rated best sellers. Main Results ‚Äì Each recommender technique generated a different list of novels. Conclusion ‚Äì The main finding from this study is that recommender systems can simplify collection development for librarians and facilitate greater access to relevant library materials for users. Academic libraries can use the same recommender techniques employed in the study to identify titles similar to highly circulated monographs or frequently requested interlibrary loans. There are several limitations to using recommender systems in libraries, including privacy concerns when analyzing user behaviour data and potential biases in machine-learning algorithms. ¬© 2024 Hancock.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197433373&doi=10.18438%2feblip30521&partnerID=40&md5=8545a97eeb14e14000ad6cca78afbe9d

Scopus,,IcaGCN: Model Intents via Coactivated Graph Convolution Network for Recommendation,Zhang J.; Yang C.,IEEE Access,2023.0,"In this era of information overload, to better provide personalized content services to users, recommendation systems have greatly improved the efficiency of information distribution. Graph Convolution Network(GCN), which is one of the representative works of graph structure aggregation processing, works by node convolution with the help of the Laplacian matrix of the graph and weighted combination of neighbor node information according to the outgoing and incoming degrees of neighbor nodes to obtain the representation of the current node. However, the mainstream GCN models nowadays do not take into account data augmentation of metadata and the fact that each node plays different roles with different importance and weights, thus making the recommendation performance limited. To better solve the above problems, we propose the IcaGCN model, which can perform data augmentation and calculate node weights in modules, and is a convenient plug-and-play method. Finally, extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets have shown the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model. Especially on the Amazon-Book dataset, our IcaGCN has improved by 6.32%, 42.29%, and 12.38% in Recall@20, MRR@20, and NDCG@20, respectively, compared to other existing state-of-the-art models.

Scopus,,Efficient graph collaborative filtering via contrastive learning,Pan Z.; Chen H.,Sensors,2021.0,"Collaborative filtering (CF) aims to make recommendations for users by detecting user‚Äôs preference from the historical user‚Äìitem interactions. Existing graph neural networks (GNN) based methods achieve satisfactory performance by exploiting the high-order connectivity between users and items, however they suffer from the poor training efficiency problem and easily introduce bias for information propagation. Moreover, the widely applied Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) loss is insufficient to provide supervision signals for training due to the extremely sparse observed interactions. To deal with the above issues, we propose the Efficient Graph Collaborative Filtering (EGCF) method. Specifically, EGCF adopts merely one-layer graph convolution to model the collaborative signal for users and items from the first-order neighbors in the user‚Äìitem interactions. Moreover, we introduce contrastive learning to enhance the representation learning of users and items by deriving the self-supervisions, which is jointly trained with the supervised learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, i.e., Yelp2018 and Amazon-book, and the experimental results demonstrate that EGCF can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in terms of Recall and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), especially on ranking the target items at right positions. In addition, EGCF shows obvious advantages in the training efficiency compared with the competitive baselines, making it practicable for potential applications. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Relevant research has long focused on measuring and improving the effectiveness of such CF systems, but alas their efficiency - especially with regards to their time- and resource-consuming training phase - has received little to no attention. This work is a first step in the direction of addressing this gap. To do so, we first perform a methodical study of the computational complexity of the training phase for a number of highly popular CF-based RSs, including approaches based on matrix factorisation, k-nearest neighbours, co-clustering, and slope one schemes. Based on this, we then build a simple yet effective predictor that, given a small sample of a dataset, is able to predict training times over the complete dataset.

Researchers have begun leveraging contrastive learning to introduce additional self-supervised signals to address this. However, this approach often unintentionally distances the target user/item from their collaborative neighbors, limiting its efficacy. In response, we propose a solution that treats the collaborative neighbors of the anchor node as positive samples within the final objective loss function. This paper focuses on developing two unique supervised contrastive loss functions that effectively combine supervision signals with contrastive loss. We analyze our proposed loss functions through the gradient lens, demonstrating that different positive samples simultaneously influence updating the anchor node‚Äôs embeddings. These samples‚Äô impact depends on their similarities to the anchor node and the negative samples. Using the graph-based collaborative filtering model as our backbone and following the same data augmentation methods as the existing contrastive learning model SGL, we effectively enhance the performance of the recommendation model. Our proposed Neighborhood-Enhanced Supervised Contrastive Loss (NESCL) model substitutes the contrastive loss function in SGL with our novel loss function, showing marked performance improvement. On three real-world datasets, Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book, our model surpasses the original SGL by 10.09%, 7.09%, and 35.36% on NDCG@20, respectively. ¬© 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181558990&doi=10.1109%2fTKDE.2023.3317068&partnerID=40&md5=20172f2161b481c2e1c58def7640a6d7

However, most of the existing recommendation models highly depended on abundant and high-quality datasets and neglected the alignment and uniformity of embedding representation. The noisy and skewed distribution of data from real-world applications is ubiquitous. The alignment and uniformity are crucial for representation learning. In this paper, we propose SHTAU (self-supervised hypergraph transformer with alignment and uniformity for the recommendation) to address the problem. Specifically, we first perform a graph neural network on the user-item interaction graph, then captures the global collaboration relationship between users and items through the hypergraph transformer structure, and use the extracted global information to generate self-supervised signals for data enhancement on the user-item interaction graph to enhance the robustness of the recommendation algorithm.

Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used to improve recommendation performance. To verify that knowledge graphs can further alleviate the above problems, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework that uses attentive knowledge graph perceptual propagation for recommendations (AKGP). This framework uses a knowledge graph as a source of auxiliary information to extract user‚Äìitem interaction information and build a sub-knowledge base. The fusion of structural and contextual information is used to construct fine-grained knowledge graphs via knowledge graph embedding methods and to generate initial embedding representations. Through multi-layer propagation, the structured information and historical preference information are embedded into a unified vector space, and the potential user‚Äìitem vector representation is expanded. This article used a knowledge perception attention module to achieve feature representation, and finally, the model was optimized using the stratified sampling joint learning method. Compared with the baseline model using MovieLens-1M, Last-FM, Book-Crossing and other data sets, the experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods, and the shortcomings of the existing model are improved. The model was applied to product design data and historical maintenance records provided by an automotive parts manufacturing company.
