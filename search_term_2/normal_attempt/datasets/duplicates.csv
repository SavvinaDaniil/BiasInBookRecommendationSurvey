These problems influence the accuracy of recommendations and easily lead to overrecommendations. This paper proposes a recommendation approach based on heterogeneous network and dynamic knowledge graph (HN-DKG). The main steps include (1) determining the implicit preferences of users according to user's cross-domain and cross-platform behaviors to form multimodal nodes and then building a heterogeneous knowledge graph; (2) Applying an improved multihead attention mechanism of the graph attention network (GAT) to realize the relationship enhancement of multimodal nodes and constructing a dynamic knowledge graph; and (3) Leveraging RippleNet to discover user's layered potential interests and rating candidate items. In which, some mechanisms, such as user seed clusters, propagation blocking, and random seed mechanisms, are designed to obtain more accurate and diverse recommendations. In this paper, the public datasets are used to evaluate the performance of algorithms, and the experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance in the effectiveness and diversity of recommendations.

Existing content-aware approaches often struggle to effectively distinguish the relative importance of content features and typically lack generalizability when processing new data.

Our model incorporates a double-tower network (DT-Net) that learns user and item representations through a meta-encoder and a mutual attention encoder, effectively mitigating the impact of noisy data on auxiliary information.

While collaborative filtering systems are popular with many state-of-the-art achievements in recommender systems, they suffer from the cold start problem, when there is no history about the users and items. Further, the latent factors learned by these methods are linear in nature. To address these gaps, we describe a novel hybrid recommender system using deep learning. The solution uses embeddings for representing users and items to learn non-linear latent factors. The solution alleviates the cold start problem by integrating side information about users and items into a very deep neural network. The proposed solution uses a decreasing learning rate in conjunction with increasing weight decay, the values cyclically varied across epochs to further improve accuracy. The proposed solution is benchmarked against existing methods on both predictive accuracy and running time. Predictive Accuracy is measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. Running time is measured by the mean and standard deviation across seven runs. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several datasets such as the MovieLens 100 K, FilmTrust, Book-Crossing and MovieLens 1 M. The results show that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods in both non-cold start and cold start cases. The proposed solution framework is generic from the outperformance on four different datasets and can be leveraged for other ratings prediction datasets in recommender systems. © 2019",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074686379&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2019.113054&partnerID=40&md5=b9813359e4319bc71fbe6d1bff39cd9b

This work provides a systematic study on the impact of broadly chosen data characteristics (DCs) of recommender systems. This is applied to the accuracy and fairness of several variations of CF recommendation models. We focus on a suite of DCs that capture properties about the structure of the user–item interaction matrix, the rating frequency, item properties, or the distribution of rating values. Experimental validation of the proposed system involved large-scale experiments by performing 23,400 recommendation simulations on three real-world datasets in the movie (ML-100K and ML-1M) and book domains (BookCrossing). The validation results show that the investigated DCs in some cases can have up to 90% of explanatory power – on several variations of classical CF algorithms –, while they can explain – in the best case – about 40% of fairness results (measured according to user gender and age sensitive attributes).

Many of these patterns reflect important real-world phenomena driving interactions between the various users and items; other patterns may be irrelevant or reflect undesired discrimination, such as discrimination in publishing or purchasing against authors who are women or ethnic minorities. In this work, we examine the response of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms to the distribution of their input data with respect to one dimension of social concern, namely content creator gender. Using publicly available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data. We find that common collaborative filtering algorithms tend to propagate at least some of each user’s tendency to rate or read male or female authors into their resulting recommendations, although they differ in both the strength of this propagation and the variance in the gender balance of the recommendation lists they produce.

One of the key dimensions for significant improvement is the concept of unexpectedness.

In particular, we propose a new concept of unexpectedness as recommending to users those items that depart from what they would expect from the system - the consideration set of each user. We define and formalize the concept of unexpectedness and discuss how it differs from the related notions of novelty, serendipity, and diversity. In addition, we suggest several mechanisms for specifying the users' expectations and propose specific performance metrics to measure the unexpectedness of recommendation lists. We also take into consideration the quality of recommendations using certain utility functions and present an algorithm for providing users with unexpected recommendations of high quality that are hard to discover but fairly match their interests.

This paper proposes a double ensemble recommendation model that combines two collaborative filtering algorithms, K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Matrix Factorization (MF). KNN is a neighbourhood-based algorithm that uses the similarity between users or items to make recommendations. At the same time, MF is a model-based algorithm that decomposes the user-item rating matrix into lower-dimensional matrices representing the latent user and item factors. The proposed double ensemble model uses KNN and MF to predict missing ratings matrix and combines their predictions using stacking. To evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble model, we conducted experiments on three datasets i.e. Movielense, BookCrossing dataset and Hindi Movie dataset and compared the results with those of single algorithm approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the double ensemble model outperforms the single algorithm approaches regarding accuracy metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Scopus,SQUIRREL: A framework for sequential group recommendations through reinforcement learning,Stratigi M.; Pitoura E.; Stefanidis K.,Information Systems,2023.0,"Nowadays, sequential recommendations are becoming more prevalent. A user expects the system to remember past interactions and not conduct each recommendation round as a stand-alone process. Additionally, group recommendation systems are more prominent since more and more people are able to form groups for activities. Subsequently, the data that a group recommendation system needs to consider becomes more complicated — historical data and feedback for each user, the items recommended and ultimately selected to and by the group, etc. This makes the selection of a group recommendation algorithm to be even more complex. In this work, we propose the SQUIRREL framework — SeQUentIal Recommendations with ReinforcEment Learning, a model that relies on reinforcement learning techniques to select the most appropriate group recommendation algorithm based on the current state of the group. At each round of recommendations, we calculate the satisfaction of each group member, how relevant each item in the group recommendation list is for each user, and based on this the model selects an action, that is, a recommendation algorithm out of a predefined set that will produce the maximum reward. We present a sample of methods that can be used; however, the model is able to be further configured with additional actions, different definitions of rewards or states. We perform experiments on three real world datasets, 20M MovieLens, GoodReads and Amazon, and show that SQUIRREL is able to outperform all the individual recommendation methods used in the action set, by correctly identifying the recommendation algorithm that maximizes the reward function utilized. © 2022 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140884417&doi=10.1016%2fj.is.2022.102128&partnerID=40&md5=393965d9e3d4638127f82b83509f87b2

Scopus,Topic-Level Bayesian Surprise and Serendipity for Recommender Systems,Hasan T.; Bunescu R.,"Proceedings  of the 17th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, RecSys 2023",2023.0,"A recommender system that optimizes its recommendations solely to fit a user's history of ratings for consumed items can create a filter bubble, wherein the user does not get to experience items from novel, unseen categories. One approach to mitigate this undesired behavior is to recommend items with high potential for serendipity, namely surprising items that are likely to be highly rated. In this paper, we propose a content-based formulation of serendipity that is rooted in Bayesian surprise and use it to measure the serendipity of items after they are consumed and rated by the user. When coupled with a collaborative-filtering component that identifies similar users, this enables recommending items with high potential for serendipity. To facilitate the evaluation of topic-level models for surprise and serendipity, we introduce a dataset of book reading histories extracted from Goodreads, containing over 26 thousand users and close to 1.3 million books, where we manually annotate 449 books read by 4 users in terms of their time-dependent, topic-level surprise. Experimental evaluations show that models that use Bayesian surprise correlate much better with the manual annotations of topic-level surprise than distance-based heuristics, and also obtain better serendipitous item recommendation performance. © 2023 ACM.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174509977&doi=10.1145%2f3604915.3608851&partnerID=40&md5=4fc04eb2bf9ee72321bef12186209685
