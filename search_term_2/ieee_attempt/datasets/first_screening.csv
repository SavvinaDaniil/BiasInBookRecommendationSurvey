Spiral of Silence and Its Application in Recommender Systems,Yes,"we develop four variants to model missing ratings. They mimic different components of the spiral of silence based on the spiral process with global opinion climate, local opinion climate, hardcore users, relationships between hardcore users and items, respectively. amazon books","['Chen Lin', 'Dugang Liu', 'Hanghang Tong', 'Yanghua Xiao']",10.1109/TKDE.2020.3013973,"It is crucial to model missing ratings in recommender systems since user preferences learnt from only observed ratings are biased. One possible explanation for missing ratings is motivated by the spiral of silence theory. When the majority opinion is formed, a spiral process is triggered where users are more and more likely to show their ratings if they perceive that they are supported by the opinion climate. In this paper we first verify the existence of the spiral process in recommender systems by using a variety of different real-life datasets. We then study the characteristics of two key factors in the spiral process: opinion climate and the hardcore users who will give ratings even when they are minority opinion holders. Based on our empirical findings, we develop four variants to model missing ratings. They mimic different components of the spiral of silence based on the spiral process with global opinion climate, local opinion climate, hardcore users, relationships between hardcore users and items, respectively. We experimentally show that, the presented variants all outperform state-of-the-art recommendation models with missing rating components.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2022
Magnitude Bounded Matrix Factorisation for Recommender Systems,No,,"['Shuai Jiang', 'Kan Li', 'Richard Da Xu']",10.1109/TKDE.2020.2998218,"Low rank matrix factorisation is often used in recommender systems as a way of extracting latent features. When dealing with large and sparse datasets, traditional recommendation algorithms face the problem of acquiring large, unrestrained, fluctuating values over predictions. Imposing bounding constraints has been proven an effective solution. However, existing bounding algorithms can only deal with one pair of fixed bounds, and are very time-consuming when applied on large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Magnitude Bounded Matrix Factorisation (MBMF), which allows different bounds for individual users/items and performs very quickly on large scale datasets. The key idea of our algorithm is to construct a model by constraining the magnitudes of each individual user/item feature vector. By converting coordinate system with radii set as the corresponding magnitudes, MBMF allows the above constrained optimisation problem to become an unconstrained one, which can be solved by unconstrained optimisation algorithms such as the stochastic gradient descent. We also explore an acceleration approach and the choice of magnitudes are given in detail as well. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that in most cases the proposed MBMF is superior over all existing algorithms in terms of accuracy and time complexity.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2022
Enhancing Recommender Systems With a Stimulus-Evoked Curiosity Mechanism,Keep,"proposes a Curiosity-drive Recommendation Framework (CdRF) which incorporates a highly innovative Stimulus evoked Curiosity mechanism (SeCM) together with a basic accuracy-oriented algorithm via Borda count. amazon books, librarything","['Ke Xu', 'Junwen Mo', 'Yi Cai', 'Huaqing Min']",10.1109/TKDE.2019.2957770,"Classical algorithms in recommender systems (RS) mainly emphasis on achieving high accuracy and thus recommend items precisely matching a user's past choices. However, the user may gradually lose interest and crave something more inspiring. In psychology, curiosity is a critical human nature and can be efficient bootstrap exploratory behaviors, thus this phenomenon can be explained as insufficient stimulation to induce curiosity regard to recommended items. Inspired from the above, this work proposes a Curiosity-drive Recommendation Framework (CdRF) which incorporates a highly innovative Stimulus-evoked Curiosity mechanism (SeCM) together with a basic accuracy-oriented algorithm via Borda count. In SeCM, we first estimate the stimulus intensity appearing on each item for each user and then model personalized curiosity among the calculated intensities using Wundt curve. For the target user, the output of CdRF is a ranked list of N N items which are both relevant and highly curiousness. We conduct extensive experiments using four public datasets to evaluate the performance of each specification of SeCM as well as the whole framework CdRF. The results reveal that SeCM can flexibly generate diversified items and CdRF can increase diversity in terms of ILS, Newness and AD while compromising very little Precision. This kind of research also offers a way to understand both individual differences in curiosity and how curiosity contributes to item exploration at the level of RS.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2021
Enhanced Multi-Task Learning and Knowledge Graph-Based Recommender System,No,,"['Min Gao', 'Jian-Yu Li', 'Chun-Hua Chen', 'Yun Li', 'Jun Zhang', 'Zhi-Hui Zhan']",10.1109/TKDE.2023.3251897,"In recent years, the multi-task learning for knowledge graph-based recommender system, termed MKR, has shown its promising performance and has attracted increasing interest, because a recommendation task and a knowledge graph embedding (KGE) task can help each other to improve the recommendation. However, MKR still has two difficult issues. The first is how fully to capture users’ historical behavior pattern in the recommendation task and how fully to utilize deep multi-relation semantic information in the KGE task. The second is how to deal with datasets with different sparsity. Tackling these challenging issues, this paper proposes an enhanced MKR (EMKR) approach with two novelties. First, we propose to utilize the attention mechanism to aggregate users’ historical behavior for more accurately mining preferences in the recommendation task, and utilize the relation-aware graph convolutional neural network to fully capture the deep multi-relation neighborhood features in the KGE task, so as to address the first issue. Second, a two-part modeling strategy is proposed for a better representation of users in the recommendation task to expand the expressive ability of the model for adapting to datasets with different sparsity, so as to address the second issue. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely-used datasets and 11 approaches are used for comparison. The results show that the proposed EMKR can achieve substantial gains over the compared state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the situation where user-item interactions are sparse.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023
GS-RS: A Generative Approach for Alleviating Cold Start and Filter Bubbles in Recommender Systems,Keep,"hm ","['Yuanbo Xu', 'En Wang', 'Yongjian Yang', 'Hui Xiong']",10.1109/TKDE.2023.3290140,"Recommender Systems (RSs) typically face the cold-start problem and the filter-bubble problem when users suffer the familiar, repeated, and even predictable recommendations, making them bored and unsatisfied. The key to solving these issues is learning users’ fine-grained preferences and recommending appealing and unexplored items deviating from users’ historical items. However, existing models consider cold-start or filter bubble problems separately and ignore that they can reinforce mutually and damage the models’ performance accuracy. To this end, we devise a novel serendipity-oriented recommender system (Generative Self-constrained Serendipitous Recommender System, GS$^{2}$2-RS) that generates users’ fine-grained preferences to enhance the recommendation performance. Specifically, GS$^{2}$2-RS extracts users’ interest and satisfaction preferences and generates virtual but convincible neighbors’ preferences from themselves with a twin Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (not from real neighbors). Then we introduce the serendipity item, which is low-interest but high-satisfaction among candidate items. We use the serendipity item to improve the diversity of recommended items, which relieves the filter-bubble problem. Along with this line, a gated mechanism is applied to their fine-grained preferences (interests, satisfactions) to obtain their serendipity items. Finally, these serendipity items are inversely injected into the original user-item rating matrix and build a relatively dense matrix as the input for backbone RS models. Note that GS$^{2}$2-RS tackles cold-start and filter-bubble problems in a unified framework without any additional side information and enriches the interpretability of recommendation models. We comprehensively validate GS$^{2}$2-RS for solving cold-start and filter bubble problems on four real-world benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments illustrate GS$^{2}$2-RS's superiority in accuracy, serendipity, and interpretability over state-of-the-art models. Also, we can plug our model into existing recommender systems as a preprocessing procedure to enhance their performance.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2024
Social Recommendation With Learning Personal and Social Latent Factors,No,,"['Huafeng Liu', 'Liping Jing', 'Jian Yu', 'Michael Ng']",10.1109/TKDE.2019.2961666,"Due to leveraging social relationships between users as well as their past social behavior, social recommendation becomes a core component in recommendation systems. Most existing social recommendation methods only consider direct social relationships among users (e.g., explicit and observed social relations). Recently, researchers proved that indirect social relationships can be effective to improve the recommendation quality when users only have few social connections, because it can identify the user interesting group even though the users have no observed social connection. In the literature, separate two-stage methods are studied, but they cannot explicitly capture the natural relationship between indirect social relations and latent user/item factors. In this paper, the main contribution is to propose a new joint recommendation model taking advantage of the Indirect Social Relations detection and Matrix Factorization collaborative filtering on social network and rating behavior information, which is called as InSRMF. In our work, the user latent factors can simultaneously and seamlessly capture user's personal preferences and social group characteristics. To optimize the InSRMF model, we develop a parallel graph vertex programming algorithm for efficiently handling large scale social recommendation data. Experiments based on four real-world datasets (Ciao, Epinions, Douban and Yelp) are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results have shown that InSRMF has ability to mine the proper indirect social relations and improve the recommendation performance compared with the testing methods in the literature, especially on the users with few social neighbors, Near-cold-start Users, Pure-cold-start Users and Long-tail Items.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2021
Discrete Matrix Factorization and Extension for Fast Item Recommendation,No,,"['Defu Lian', 'Xing Xie', 'Enhong Chen']",10.1109/TKDE.2019.2951386,"Binary representation of users and items can dramatically improve efficiency of recommendation and reduce size of recommendation models. However, learning optimal binary codes for them is challenging due to binary constraints, even if squared loss is optimized. In this article, we propose a general framework for discrete matrix factorization based on discrete optimization, which can 1) optimize multiple loss functions; 2) handle both explicit and implicit feedback datasets; and 3) take auxiliary information into account without any hyperparameters. To tackle the challenging discrete optimization problem, we propose block coordinate descent based on semidefinite relaxation of binary quadratic programming. We theoretically show that it is equivalent to discrete coordinate descent when only one coordinate is in each block. We extensively evaluate the proposed algorithms on eight real-world datasets. The results of evaluation show that they outperform the state-of-the-art baselines significantly and that auxiliary information of items improves recommendation performance. For better showing the advantages of binary representation, we further propose a two-stage recommender system, consisting of an item-recalling stage and a subsequent fine-ranking stage. Its extensive evaluation shows hashing can dramatically accelerate item recommendation with little degradation of accuracy.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2021
Meta Auxiliary Learning for Top-K Recommendation,No,,"['Ximing Li', 'Chen Ma', 'Guozheng Li', 'Peng Xu', 'Chi Liu', 'Ye Yuan', 'Guoren Wang']",10.1109/TKDE.2022.3223155,"Recommender systems are playing a significant role in modern society to alleviate the information/choice overload problem, since Internet users may feel hard to identify the most favorite items or products from millions of candidates. Thanks to the recent successes in computer vision, auxiliary learning has become a powerful means to improve the performance of a target (primary) task. Even though helpful, the auxiliary learning scheme is still less explored in recommendation models. To integrate the auxiliary learning scheme, we propose a novel meta auxiliary learning framework to facilitate the recommendation model training, i.e., user and item latent representations. Specifically, we construct two self-supervised learning tasks, regarding both users and items, as auxiliary tasks to enhance the representation effectiveness of users and items. Then the auxiliary and primary tasks are further modeled as a meta learning paradigm to adaptively control the contribution of auxiliary tasks for improving the primary recommendation task. This is achieved by an implicit gradient method guaranteeing less time complexity compared with conventional meta learning methods. Via a comparison using four real-world datasets with a number of state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed model outperforms the best existing models on the Top-K recommendation by 3% to 23%.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023
Semantic Interpretation of Top-N Recommendations,No,,"['Vito Anelli', 'Tommaso Di Noia', 'Eugenio Di Sciascio', 'Azzura Ragone', 'Joseph Trotta']",10.1109/TKDE.2020.3010215,"Over the years, model-based approaches have shown their effectiveness in computing recommendation lists in different domains and settings. By relying on the computation of latent factors, they can recommend items with a very high level of accuracy. Unfortunately, when moving to the latent space, even if the model embeds content-based information, we miss references to the actual semantics of the recommended item. It makes the interpretation of the recommendation process non-trivial. In this paper, we show how to initialize latent factors in Factorization Machines by using semantic features coming from knowledge graphs to train an interpretable model, which is, in turn, able to provide recommendations with a high level of accuracy. In the presented approach, semantic features are injected into the learning process to retain the original informativeness of the items available in the dataset. By relying on the information encoded in the original knowledge graph, we also propose two metrics to evaluate the semantic accuracy and robustness of knowledge-aware interpretability. An extensive experimental evaluation on six different datasets shows the effectiveness of the interpretable model in terms of both accuracy and diversity of recommendation results and interpretability robustness.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2022
Contextualized Graph Attention Network for Recommendation With Item Knowledge Graph,No,,"['Yong Liu', 'Susen Yang', 'Yonghui Xu', 'Chunyan Miao', 'Min Wu', 'Juyong Zhang']",10.1109/TKDE.2021.3082948,"Graph neural networks (GNN) have recently been applied to exploit knowledge graph (KG) for recommendation. Existing GNN-based methods explicitly model the dependency between an entity and its local graph context in KG (i.e., the set of its first-order neighbors), but may not be effective in capturing its non-local graph context (i.e., the set of most related high-order neighbors). In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation framework, named Contextualized Graph Attention Network (CGAT), which can explicitly exploit both local and non-local graph context information of an entity in KG. More specifically, CGAT captures the local context information by a user-specific graph attention mechanism, considering a user’s personalized preferences on entities. In addition, CGAT employs a biased random walk sampling process to extract the non-local context of an entity, and utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the dependency between the entity and its non-local contextual entities. To capture the user’s personalized preferences on items, an item-specific attention mechanism is also developed to model the dependency between a target item and the contextual items extracted from the user’s historical behaviors. We compared CGAT with state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods on real datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CGAT.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023
Graph-Based Embedding Smoothing for Sequential Recommendation,No,,"['Tianyu Zhu', 'Leilei Sun', 'Guoqing Chen']",10.1109/TKDE.2021.3073411,"In real-world scenarios, a user's interactions with items could be formalized as a behavior sequence, indicating his/her dynamic and evolutionary preferences. To this end, a series of recent efforts in recommender systems aim at improving recommendation performance by considering the sequential information. However, impacts of sequential behavior on future interactions may vary greatly in different scenarios. Additionally, semantic item relations underlying item attributes have not been well exploited in sequential recommendation models, which could be crucial for measuring item similarities in recommendation. To deal with the above problems, this paper provides a general embedding smoothing framework for sequential recommendation models. Specifically, we first construct a hybrid item graph by fusing sequential item relations derived from user-item interactions with semantic item relations built upon item attributes. Second, we perform graph convolutions on the hybrid item graph to generate smoothed item embeddings. Finally, we equip sequential recommendation models with the smoothed item representations to enhance their performances. Experimental results demonstrate that with our embedding smoothing framework, the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation model, SASRec, achieves superior performance to most baseline methods on three real-world datasets. Moreover, the results show that most mainstream sequential recommendation models could benefit from our framework.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023
Reinforcement Learning Based Path Exploration for Sequential Explainable Recommendation,No,,"['Yicong Li', 'Hongxu Chen', 'Yile Li', 'Lin Li', 'Philip Yu', 'Guandong Xu']",10.1109/TKDE.2023.3237741,"Recent advances in path-based explainable recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention thanks to the rich information from knowledge graphs. Most existing explainable recommendations only utilize static knowledge graphs and ignore the dynamic user-item evolutions, leading to less convincing and inaccurate explanations. Although some works boost the performance and explainability of recommendations through modeling the user's temporal sequential behavior, most of them either only focus on modeling the user's sequential interactions within a path or independently and separately of the recommendation mechanism. Moreover, some path-based explainable recommendations use random selection or traditional machine learning methods to decrease the volume of explainable paths, which cannot guarantee high quality of the explainable paths for the recommendation. To deal with the problem, recent path exploration use reinforcement learning to improve diversity and quality. However, unsupervised training leads to low-efficiency path exploration. Therefore, we propose a novel Temporal Meta-path Guided Explainable Recommendation leveraging Reinforcement Learning (TMER-RL), which utilizes supervised reinforcement learning to explore item-item paths between consecutive items with attention mechanisms to sequentially model dynamic user-item evolutions on a dynamic knowledge graph for the explainable recommendation. Extensive evaluations of TMER-RL on two real-world datasets show state-of-the-art performance compared to recent strong baselines.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023
Sylvester Equation Induced Collaborative Representation Learning for Recommendation,No,,"['Xingyuan Li', 'Zhenfeng Zhu', 'Shuai Zheng', 'Zhizhe Liu', 'Youru Li', 'Xiaobo Guo', 'Deqiang Kong', 'Yao Zhao']",10.1109/TKDE.2022.3217090,"For an actual recommendation system, it generally involves a variety of heterogeneous interactive relationships, such as the typical user-user (U2U), item-item (I2I), and user-item (U2I) interaction relationships. With the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) in embedding various interactive relations, recommendation technology has made gratifying progress in recent years, which benefits lot from its powerful ability in relation modeling. However, most of the existing GNN-based methods fail to collaboratively explore the above heterogeneous multiple interactive relationships, including the internal correlations among multiple relationships and the intrinsic association behind different relationships. As a consequence, the user's personalized preference for the items to be recommended will not be well captured. In this paper, we propose a Sylvester equation induced Collaborative Representation Learning framework (S-CRL) for recommendation system by utilizing the heterogeneous multiple interactive relationships. In particular, we ingeniously define a novel Sylvester equation to associate tactfully the multiple heterogeneous relations together. From the perspective of rating propagation, such Sylvester equation is shown theoretically to be the optimal solution of a local structure sensitive rating propagation function. Additionally, to seek more expressive embeddings about user and item, a layer-wise attention is introduced to aggregate the multi-hop information from U2U and I2I graphs, respectively, so as to promote the aggregation with the corresponding embeddings from the U2I interaction graph. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets verify that our model achieves more favorable performance over currently representative methods.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023
Training Recommenders Over Large Item Corpus With Importance Sampling,No,,"['Defu Lian', 'Zhenguo Gao', 'Xia Song', 'Yucheng Li', 'Qi Liu', 'Enhong Chen']",10.1109/TKDE.2023.3344657,"By predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items, item recommendation helps users determine the information they need. While optimizing a ranking-focused loss is more in line with the objectives of item recommendation, previous studies have indicated that current sampling-based ranking methods don't always surpass non-sampling ones. This is because it is either inefficient to sample a pool of representative negatives for better generalization or challenging to gauge their contributions to ranking-focused losses accurately. To this end, we propose a novel weighted ranking loss, which weights each negative with the softmax probability based on model's predictive score. Our theoretical analysis suggests that optimizing this loss boosts the normalized discounted cumulative gain. Furthermore, it appears that this loss acts as an approximate analytic solution for adversarial training of personalized ranking. To improve optimization efficiency, we approximate the weighted ranking loss with self-normalized importance sampling and show that the loss has good generalization properties. To improve generalization, we further develop efficient cluster-based negative samplers based on clustering over item vectors, to decrease approximation error caused by the divergence between the proposal and the target distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our methods remarkably outperform leading item recommendation algorithms.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023
SamWalker++: Recommendation With Informative Sampling Strategy,No,,"['Can Wang', 'Jiawei Chen', 'Sheng Zhou', 'Qihao Shi', 'Yan Feng', 'Chun Chen']",10.1109/TKDE.2021.3102080,"Recommendation from implicit feedback is a highly challenging task due to the lack of reliable negative feedback data. Existing methods address this challenge by treating all the un-observed data as negative (dislike) but downweight the confidence of these data. However, this treatment causes two problems: (1) Confidence weights of the unobserved data are usually assigned manually, which lack flexibility and may create empirical bias on evaluating user's preference. (2) To handle massive volume of the unobserved feedback data, most of the existing methods rely on stochastic inference and data sampling strategies. However, since a user is only aware of a very small fraction of items in a large dataset, it is difficult for existing samplers to select informative training instances in which the user really dislikes the item rather than does not know it. To address the above two problems, we propose two novel recommendation methods SamWalker and SamWalker++ that support both adaptive confidence assignment and efficient model learning. SamWalker models data confidence with a social network-aware function, which can adaptively specify different weights to different data according to users’ social contexts. However, the social network information may not be available in many recommender systems, which hinders application of SamWalker. Thus, we further propose SamWalker++, which does not require any side information and models data confidence with a constructed pseudo-social network. In the pseudo-social network, similar users are connected with specific item nodes or community nodes. This way, the inference of one's data confidence can benefit from the knowledge from other similar users. We also develop fast random-walk-based sampling strategies for our SamWalker and SamWalker++ to adaptively draw informative training instances, which can speed up gradient estimation and reduce sampling variance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SamWalker and SamWalker++.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023
Personalized Elastic Embedding Learning for On-Device Recommendation,No,,"['Ruiqi Zheng', 'Liang Qu', 'Tong Chen', 'Kai Zheng', 'Yuhui Shi', 'Hongzhi Yin']",10.1109/TKDE.2024.3361562,"To address privacy concerns and reduce network latency, there has been a recent trend of compressing cumbersome recommendation models trained on the cloud and deploying compact recommender models to resource-limited devices for the real-time recommendation. Existing solutions generally overlook device heterogeneity and user heterogeneity. They require devices with the same budget to share the same model and assume the available device resources (e.g., memory) are constant, which is not reflective of reality. Considering device and user heterogeneities as well as dynamic resource constraints, this article proposes a Personalized Elastic Embedding Learning framework (PEEL) for the on-device recommendation, which generates Personalized Elastic Embeddings (PEEs) for devices with various memory budgets in a once-for-all manner, adapting to new or dynamic budgets, and addressing user preference diversity by assigning personalized embeddings for different groups of users. Specifically, it pretrains a global embedding table with collected user-item interaction instances and clusters users into groups. Then, it refines the embedding tables with local interaction instances within each group. PEEs are generated from the group-wise embedding blocks and their weights that indicate the contribution of each embedding block to the local recommendation performance. Given a memory budget, PEEL efficiently generates PEEs by selecting embedding blocks with the largest weights, making it adaptable to dynamic memory budgets on devices. Furthermore, a diversity-driven regularizer is implemented to encourage the expressiveness of embedding blocks, and a controller is utilized to optimize the weights. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets, and the results show that PEEL yields superior performance on devices with heterogeneous and dynamic memory budgets.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2024
Task Trail: An Effective Segmentation of User Search Behavior,No,,"['Zhen Liao', 'Yang Song', 'Yalou Huang', 'Li-wei He', 'Qi He']",10.1109/TKDE.2014.2316794,"In this paper, we introduce “task trail” to understand user search behaviors. We define a task to be an atomic user information need, whereas a task trail represents all user activities within that particular task, such as query reformulations, URL clicks. Previously, web search logs have been studied mainly at session or query level where users may submit several queries within one task and handle several tasks within one session. Although previous studies have addressed the problem of task identification, little is known about the advantage of using task over session or query for search applications. In this paper, we conduct extensive analyses and comparisons to evaluate the effectiveness of task trails in several search applications: determining user satisfaction, predicting user search interests, and suggesting related queries. Experiments on large scale data sets of a commercial search engine show that: (1) Task trail performs better than session and query trails in determining user satisfaction; (2) Task trail increases webpage utilities of end users comparing to session and query trails; (3) Task trails are comparable to query trails but more sensitive than session trails in measuring different ranking functions; (4) Query terms from the same task are more topically consistent to each other than query terms from different tasks; (5) Query suggestion based on task trail is a good complement of query suggestions based on session trail and click-through bipartite. The findings in this paper verify the need of extracting task trails from web search logs and enhance applications in search and recommendation systems.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014
Beyond Similarity: Relation-Based Collaborative Filtering,No,,"['Guannan Liu', 'Liang Zhang', 'Junjie Wu']",10.1109/TKDE.2021.3099217,"Given the effectiveness and ease of use, Item-based Collaborative Filtering (ICF) methods have been broadly used in industry and are widely investigated in recent years. The key of ICF lies in the similarity measurement between items, which however is a coarse-grained numerical value that can hardly capture users’ fine-grained preferences toward different attributed aspects of items. In this paper, we propose a model called REDA (Relation Embedding with Dual Attentions) to address this challenge, based on which a new paradigm called Relation-based Collaborative Filtering is designed for high-performance recommendation. REDA is essentially a deep neural network model that employs an item relation embedding scheme for inter-item relations representation. It features in multi-decomposed item embedding with dual-attention refinement and employs a novel relation-wise optimization scheme for end-to-end learning. A relational user embedding is then proposed by aggregating item relation embeddings between all purchased items of a user, which not only profiles users’ fine-grained preferences but also alleviates the data sparsity problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world datasets and the proposed REDA is shown to outperform ten state-of-the-art methods. In particular, REDA shows great robustness against data and relation sparsity, the ability to learn explainable item aspects, and the potential for large-scale recommendation.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2023

Harnessing Folksonomies to Produce a Social Classification of Resources,No,,"['Arkaitz Zubiaga', 'Víctor Fresno', 'Raquel Martínez', 'Alberto García-Plaza']",10.1109/TKDE.2012.115,"In our daily lives, organizing resources like books or webpages into a set of categories to ease future access is a common task. The usual largeness of these collections requires a vast endeavor and an outrageous expense to organize manually. As an approach to effectively produce an automated classification of resources, we consider the immense amounts of annotations provided by users on social tagging systems in the form of bookmarks. In this paper, we deal with the utilization of these user-provided tags to perform a social classification of resources. For this purpose, we have created three large-scale social tagging data sets including tagging data for different types of resources, webpages and books. Those resources are accompanied by categorization data from sound expert-driven taxonomies.

Large Language Models on Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey,No,,"['Bowen Jin', 'Gang Liu', 'Chi Han', 'Meng Jiang', 'Heng Ji', 'Jiawei Han']",10.1109/TKDE.2024.3469578,"Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT4 and LLaMA, are creating significant advancements in natural language processing, due to their strong text encoding/decoding ability and newly found emergent capability (e.g., reasoning). While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are many real-world scenarios where text data is associated with rich structure information in the form of graphs (e.g., academic networks, and e-commerce networks) or scenarios where graph data is paired with rich textual information (e.g., molecules with descriptions). Besides, although LLMs have shown their pure text-based reasoning ability, it is underexplored whether such ability can be generalized to graphs (i.e., graph-based reasoning). In this paper, we provide a systematic review of scenarios and techniques related to large language models on graphs. We first summarize potential scenarios of adopting LLMs on graphs into three categories, namely pure graphs, text-attributed graphs, and text-paired graphs. We then discuss detailed techniques for utilizing LLMs on graphs, including LLM as Predictor, LLM as Encoder, and LLM as Aligner, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different schools of models. Furthermore, we discuss the real-world applications of such methods and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets.
