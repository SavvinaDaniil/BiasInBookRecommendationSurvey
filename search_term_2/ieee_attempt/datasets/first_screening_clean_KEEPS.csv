Enhancing Recommender Systems With a Stimulus-Evoked Curiosity Mechanism,Keep,"proposes a Curiosity-drive Recommendation Framework (CdRF) which incorporates a highly innovative Stimulus evoked Curiosity mechanism (SeCM) together with a basic accuracy-oriented algorithm via Borda count. amazon books, librarything","['Ke Xu', 'Junwen Mo', 'Yi Cai', 'Huaqing Min']",10.1109/TKDE.2019.2957770,"Classical algorithms in recommender systems (RS) mainly emphasis on achieving high accuracy and thus recommend items precisely matching a user's past choices. However, the user may gradually lose interest and crave something more inspiring. In psychology, curiosity is a critical human nature and can be efficient bootstrap exploratory behaviors, thus this phenomenon can be explained as insufficient stimulation to induce curiosity regard to recommended items. Inspired from the above, this work proposes a Curiosity-drive Recommendation Framework (CdRF) which incorporates a highly innovative Stimulus-evoked Curiosity mechanism (SeCM) together with a basic accuracy-oriented algorithm via Borda count. In SeCM, we first estimate the stimulus intensity appearing on each item for each user and then model personalized curiosity among the calculated intensities using Wundt curve. For the target user, the output of CdRF is a ranked list of N N items which are both relevant and highly curiousness. We conduct extensive experiments using four public datasets to evaluate the performance of each specification of SeCM as well as the whole framework CdRF. The results reveal that SeCM can flexibly generate diversified items and CdRF can increase diversity in terms of ILS, Newness and AD while compromising very little Precision. This kind of research also offers a way to understand both individual differences in curiosity and how curiosity contributes to item exploration at the level of RS.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2021
GS-RS: A Generative Approach for Alleviating Cold Start and Filter Bubbles in Recommender Systems,Keep,hm ,"['Yuanbo Xu', 'En Wang', 'Yongjian Yang', 'Hui Xiong']",10.1109/TKDE.2023.3290140,"Recommender Systems (RSs) typically face the cold-start problem and the filter-bubble problem when users suffer the familiar, repeated, and even predictable recommendations, making them bored and unsatisfied. The key to solving these issues is learning users’ fine-grained preferences and recommending appealing and unexplored items deviating from users’ historical items. However, existing models consider cold-start or filter bubble problems separately and ignore that they can reinforce mutually and damage the models’ performance accuracy. To this end, we devise a novel serendipity-oriented recommender system (Generative Self-constrained Serendipitous Recommender System, GS$^{2}$2-RS) that generates users’ fine-grained preferences to enhance the recommendation performance. Specifically, GS$^{2}$2-RS extracts users’ interest and satisfaction preferences and generates virtual but convincible neighbors’ preferences from themselves with a twin Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (not from real neighbors). Then we introduce the serendipity item, which is low-interest but high-satisfaction among candidate items. We use the serendipity item to improve the diversity of recommended items, which relieves the filter-bubble problem. Along with this line, a gated mechanism is applied to their fine-grained preferences (interests, satisfactions) to obtain their serendipity items. Finally, these serendipity items are inversely injected into the original user-item rating matrix and build a relatively dense matrix as the input for backbone RS models. Note that GS$^{2}$2-RS tackles cold-start and filter-bubble problems in a unified framework without any additional side information and enriches the interpretability of recommendation models. We comprehensively validate GS$^{2}$2-RS for solving cold-start and filter bubble problems on four real-world benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments illustrate GS$^{2}$2-RS's superiority in accuracy, serendipity, and interpretability over state-of-the-art models. Also, we can plug our model into existing recommender systems as a preprocessing procedure to enhance their performance.",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2024
