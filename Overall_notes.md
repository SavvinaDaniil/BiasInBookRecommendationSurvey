### For the analysis:

1. Code provided: Search for "code", "repo", "github", "reprod". If not, check papers with code (or generally code). If not, then no
2. Hyperparameter tuning: Search for "hyperparam", "tun", read experimentals set up. If nothing mentione, then unclear
3. Dataset preprocessing: Read datasets part, check also the table. If different but unmentioned, unmentioned yes.


! To be included in the survey, papers need to explicitly claim to address some form of bias (e.g., not just say in the preliminary that increasing aggregate diversity helps with pop bias with explicitly measuring it)

Ok so I am officially done with reading papers. Now i need to think about a plan.

**What should Gauri know? What is expected from her?**
1. I plan to complete the paper within the next 4 to 6 weeks (ideally 4 given the fact that I am leaving for CPH March first).
2. There will be a section in the paper with background info on LIS. There should be papers that describe potential dangers of recommender systems in the public library sector and/or what would make such systems inclusive. So how things could be and how they should be.
3. I expect Gauri to work on the part above, as well as review and give opinion on the paper as a whole. Invite her to Overleaf.
4. The plan is to submit this paper at a journal, specifically ACM TORS.
5. Gauri will be co-author of the paper (with me as lead author, and Laura as PI)
6. We should make a timeline. What is her availability?


### Plan
1. [x]  Describe prisma methodology and how you used it
2. [ ]  Write more in introduction
3. [ ]  Go through the prisma steps
4. [ ]  Results:
    1. [ ]  Overall statistics
    2. [ ]  Statistics per column (e.g., dataset, code provided etc)
    3. [ ]  Divide into: statistical, social
    4. [ ]  Divide into: user, provider (who are providers)
5. [ ]  Expand discussion
