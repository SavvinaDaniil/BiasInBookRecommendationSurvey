Scopus,Yes,The Unfairness of Popularity Bias in Book Recommendation,Naghiaei M.; Rahmani H.A.; Dehghan M.,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2022.0,"Recent studies have shown that recommendation systems commonly suffer from popularity bias. Popularity bias refers to the problem that popular items (i.e., frequently rated items) are recommended frequently while less popular items are recommended rarely or not at all. Researchers adopted two approaches to examining popularity bias: (i) from the users’ perspective, by analyzing how far a recommendation system deviates from user’s expectations in receiving popular items, and (ii) by analyzing the amount of exposure that long-tail items receive, measured by overall catalog coverage and novelty. In this paper, we examine the first point of view in the book domain, although the findings may be applied to other domains as well. To this end, we analyze the well-known Book-Crossing dataset and define three user groups based on their tendency towards popular items (i.e., Niche, Diverse, Bestseller-focused). Further, we evaluate the performance of nine state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and two baselines (i.e., Random, MostPop) from both the accuracy (e.g., NDCG, Precision, Recall) and popularity bias perspectives. Our results indicate that most state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in the book domain, and fail to meet users’ expectations with Niche and Diverse tastes despite having a larger profile size. Conversely, Bestseller-focused users are more likely to receive high-quality recommendations, both in terms of fairness and personalization. Furthermore, our study shows a tradeoff between personalization and unfairness of popularity bias in recommendation algorithms for users belonging to the Diverse and Bestseller groups, that is, algorithms with high capability of personalization suffer from the unfairness of popularity bias. Finally, across the models, our results show that WMF and VAECF can provide a higher quality recommendation when considering both accuracy and fairness perspectives. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134358321&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-09316-6_7&partnerID=40&md5=548f25798dbb919d482bf020f932d01b

This suggested that the most important factor in determining results was Research Group, i.e., who conducts the experiment is more important than the classifier algorithms being investigated. A recent re-analysis [2] sought to argue that the effect is less strong than originally claimed since there is a relationship between Research Group and Dataset. In this response we show (i) the re-analysis is based on a small (21 percent) subset of our original data, (ii) using the same re-analysis approach with a larger subset shows that Research Group is more important than type of Classifier and (iii) however the data are analysed there is compelling evidence that who conducts the research has an effect on the results. This means that the problem of researcher bias remains. Addressing it should be seen as a matter of priority amongst those of us who conduct and publish experiments comparing the performance of competing software defect prediction systems. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028922080&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2017.2731308&partnerID=40&md5=7d3c7542dd61f132b7e7e29a83c2ff42

An important part of Knowledge Management is the classification and organisation of knowledge to make it findable and reveal connections in related subjects. Discussion on the ethical aspects of this issue have recently been brought to the fore in both Library and Information Studies (LIS), in terms of objections to Library classification terms, and also in AI which can classify data using data sets which themselves reflect existing injustices and bias. The ethical implications of both types of knowledge classification can be better understood when the classification ethics debate in LIS and AI are used to inform each other. Findings include that AI provides clarity on measuring adverse outcomes whilst LIS provides nuance on the potential cultural and psychological harm of inappropriate terminology and inaccurate positioning within ‘worlds of knowledge’. © 2022, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Public library storytime programs serve as venues to showcase books with characters of varied backgrounds, identities, and experiences who may or may not reflect those of the communities the libraries serve. Because storytime providers often rely on online resources to plan their programs, it is important to investigate the presence and quality of EDI elements in books recommended for storytimes by these resources. The present study analyzed the text, illustrations, and WorldCat metadata for a random sample of 481 children's books recommended by six popular online resources for storytime planning. Results revealed an overall lack of EDI in the recommended books with few characters representing parallel cultures, living with a disability or chronic illness, practicing a religion other than Christianity, or communicating in a language other than English.

To tackle this issue, this study introduces a novel hybrid model that combines graph convolutional networks (GCN) based on bipartite graphs and neural matrix factorization (NMF). This model aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of children’s book recommendations by accurately capturing user biases. In this model, the complex interactions between users and books are modeled as a bipartite graph, with the users’ book ratings serving as the weights of the edges. Through GCN and NMF, we can delve into the structure of the graph and the behavioral patterns of users, more accurately identify and address user biases, and predict their future behaviors. Compared to traditional recommendation systems, our hybrid model excels in handling large-scale user review data. Experimental results confirm that our model has significantly improved in terms of recommendation accuracy and scalability, positively contributing to the advancement of children’s book recommendation systems. © 2024 Shen and Jian",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190275288&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj-cs.1858&partnerID=40&md5=5d0f6d16bef32eae8f732485e1e4b578

Data-driven software is increasingly applied in social-critical applications where ensuring fairness is of paramount importance. The existing approaches focus on addressing fairness bugs by either modifying the input dataset or modifying the learning algorithms. On the other hand, the selection of hyperparameters, which provide finer controls of ML algorithms, may enable a less intrusive approach to influence the fairness. Can hyperparameters amplify or suppress discrimination present in the input dataset? How can we help programmers in detecting, understanding, and exploiting the role of hyperparameters to improve the fairness? We design three search-based software testing algorithms to un-cover the precision-fairness frontier of the hyperparameter space. We complement these algorithms with statistical debugging to explain the role of these parameters in improving fairness. We implement the proposed approaches in the tool Parfait-ML (PARameter FAIrness Testing for ML Libraries) and show its effectiveness and utility over five mature ML algorithms as used in six social-critical applications. In these applications, our approach successfully iden-tified hyperparameters that significantly improve (vis-a-vis the state-of-the-art techniques) the fairness without sacrificing precision. Surprisingly, for some algorithms (e.g., random forest), our approach showed that certain configuration of hyperparameters (e.g., restricting the search space of attributes) can amplify biases across applications. Upon further investigation, we found intuitive explanations of these phenomena, and the results corroborate simi-lar observations from the literature. © 2022 ACM.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131378824&doi=10.1145%2f3510003.3510202&partnerID=40&md5=d581225a80d3c8bd9ceeb99e8b568dbd

Scopus,Yes,Representation of Libraries in Artificial Intelligence Regulations and Implications for Ethics and Practice,Bradley F.,Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association,2022.0,"We are already living in an algorithmic society. AI policies and regulations are now emerging at the same time as more is learned about the implications of bias in machine learning sets, the surveillance risks of smart cities and facial recognition, and automated decision-making by government, among many other applications of AI and machine learning. Each of these issues raises concerns around ethics, privacy, and data protection. This paper introduces some of the key AI regulatory developments to date and engagement by libraries in these processes. While many AI applications are largely emergent and hypothetical in libraries, some mature examples can be identified in research literature searching, language tools for textual analysis, and access to collection data. The paper presents a summary of how library activities such as these are represented in national AI plans and ways that libraries have engaged with other aspects of AI regulation including the development of ethical frameworks. Based on the sector's expertise in related regulatory issues including copyright and data protection, the paper suggests further opportunities to contribute to the future of ethical, trustworthy, and transparent AI. © 2022 Fiona Bradley.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135832248&doi=10.1080%2f24750158.2022.2101911&partnerID=40&md5=1ff33093412d54d1b2d582fce4f4fe00

This paper incorporates the major entity level metrics found in the heterogeneous publication networks into a pattern mining process in order to recommend academic reviewers and potential research collaborators. In essence, the paper integrates authors' h-index and papers' citation count and proposes a quantification to account for the author diversity into one formula duped impact to measure the real influence of a scientific paper. Thereafter, this paper formulates two kinds of target patterns and mines them harnessing the high-utility itemset mining (HUIM) framework. The first pattern, researcher-general topic patterns (RGP), is a pattern that includes only researchers; whereas, the researcher-specific topic patterns (RSP) is comprised of combinations of researchers and keywords that summarize their niche of expertise. The HUI algorithms of Two Phase, IHUP, UP-Growth, FHM, FHN, HUINIV-Mine, D2HUP, and EFIM were compared on two real-world citation datasets related to Deep Learning and HUIM, in addition to the open source mushroom dataset. The EFIM algorithm showed good performance in terms of run time and memory usage. Consequently, it was then used to mine the patterns within the proposed framework. The discovered patterns of RGP and RSP showed high coverage, proving the efficiency of the proposed framework. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061698863&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2894680&partnerID=40&md5=7fa7b75038dc7022b47bb62edd75346a

Before starting work, similar studies on a similar topic are reviewed to find out what has already been researched and tested, and what is still worth investigating. Also, from these studies, it was possible to find many clues about which implementation methods and tools are better to choose, and which work better for this task. The project work is carefully planned using process diagrams and data flows. The best methods and tools for the implementation of this project were studied, and simple classification and regression models of Random Forest became such tools. Such models were chosen, because they cope with the task quite well, and are much less resource-intensive than the same large language models, in addition, they are very easy to use and configure. Two datasets were selected, a dataset with blogs and a dataset with books. The dataset with blogs was used the most because it contains both the age and gender of the blog author. The prediction accuracy of the ""book"" model is 0.8, and with blogs - 0.6. Before use, the data was analysed and cleaned, later transformed into embeddings and sent for model training. The results of the model are studied and analysed in detail. Many useful features are extracted that are responsible for classifying the age or gender of the author in the texts. In addition, many interesting regularities were observed in the process of analysing the results. Additionally, a test case is implemented that allows the user to easily interact with my model. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198914736&partnerID=40&md5=2dafaf779a1e321a1e6299357f429998

Scopus,No,Ethnicity-based name partitioning for author name disambiguation using supervised machine learning,Kim J.; Kim J.; Owen-Smith J.,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2021.0,"In several author name disambiguation studies, some ethnic name groups such as East Asian names are reported to be more difficult to disambiguate than others. This implies that disambiguation approaches might be improved if ethnic name groups are distinguished before disambiguation. We explore the potential of ethnic name partitioning by comparing performance of four machine learning algorithms trained and tested on the entire data or specifically on individual name groups. Results show that ethnicity-based name partitioning can substantially improve disambiguation performance because the individual models are better suited for their respective name group. The improvements occur across all ethnic name groups with different magnitudes. Performance gains in predicting matched name pairs outweigh losses in predicting nonmatched pairs. Feature (e.g., coauthor name) similarities of name pairs vary across ethnic name groups. Such differences may enable the development of ethnicity-specific feature weights to improve prediction for specific ethic name categories. These findings are observed for three labeled data with a natural distribution of problem sizes as well as one in which all ethnic name groups are controlled for the same sizes of ambiguous names. This study is expected to motive scholars to group author names based on ethnicity prior to disambiguation. © 2021 The Authors.

Different techniques are used to extract the required information using text analysis, like author identification on social media and for Short Text Message Service. Author profiling helps in security and blogs for identification purposes while capturing authors’ writing behaviors through messages, posts, comments, blogs, comments, and chat logs. Most of the work in this area has been done in English and other native languages. On the other hand, Roman Urdu is also getting attention for the author profiling task, but it needs to convert Roman-Urdu to English to extract important features like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and other linguistic features. The conversion may lose important information while having limitations in converting one language to another language. This research explores machine learning techniques that can be used for all languages to overcome the conversion limitation. The Vector Space Model (VSM) and Query Likelihood (Q.L.) are used to identify the author’s age and gender.

The high level of quality of feedback from AI tools leads to the spread of AI plagiarism – unauthorized borrowing of generative AI materials – among students. The purpose of this study is to: a) highlight aspects that determine students’ understanding of the issues of compliance with author’s ethics and the problem of plagiarism when interacting with generative AI; b) develop a questionnaire to determine students’ understanding of the issues of compliance with author’s ethics and the problem of AI plagiarism; c) conduct an online survey of university students, analyze and discuss the results obtained. The paper highlights five aspects that determine students’ understanding of the issues of compliance with author’s ethics and the problem of AI plagiarism when completing educational assignments and preparing research texts: a) students’ general understanding of the issues of compliance with author’s ethics and the problem of plagiarism in an academic environment; b) students’ experience of AI tools for educational purposes; c) students’ understanding of the problem of AI plagiarism and attitude towards borrowing materials from generative AI; d) teachers’ actions to prevent AI plagiarism among students; e) the policy of educational organizations regarding student compliance with ethics and AI plagiarism. An online questionnaire was developed to determine the degree to which students understand the issues of compliance with copyright ethics and the problem of AI plagiarism. 1,599 students from 29 universities of the Russian Federation took part in the survey. The results showed that in general, in the Russian student community, plagiarism is a widespread social phenomenon, many types of which are perceived by young people as a norm of academic behavior. Despite the relatively high awareness of students in the field of AI technologies, the extremely rare use by teachers of specialized subject disciplines of AI tools in the educational process I’d the reason for the current low level of spread of AI plagiarism in the academic environment. At the same time, it is necessary to state that students lack a systematic understanding of exactly how they can “legally” use generative AI materials and what exactly will be considered AI plagiarism. According to students, the importance of understanding the issues of compliance with author ethics and the problem of AI plagiarism will depend, on the one hand, on the actions of teachers to explain to students the rules for using generative AI materials, and on the other hand, the presence in universities of a regulatory framework regulating the field and the extent to which students use AI in the educational process. © 2024 Moscow Polytechnic University.

Scopus,Yes,Exploring author gender in book rating and recommendation,Ekstrand M.D.; Kluver D.,User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction,2021.0,"Collaborative filtering algorithms find useful patterns in rating and consumption data and exploit these patterns to guide users to good items. Many of these patterns reflect important real-world phenomena driving interactions between the various users and items; other patterns may be irrelevant or reflect undesired discrimination, such as discrimination in publishing or purchasing against authors who are women or ethnic minorities. In this work, we examine the response of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms to the distribution of their input data with respect to one dimension of social concern, namely content creator gender. Using publicly available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data. We find that common collaborative filtering algorithms tend to propagate at least some of each user’s tendency to rate or read male or female authors into their resulting recommendations, although they differ in both the strength of this propagation and the variance in the gender balance of the recommendation lists they produce. The data, experimental design, and statistical methods are designed to be reusable for studying potentially discriminatory social dimensions of recommendations in other domains and settings as well. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100480096&doi=10.1007%2fs11257-020-09284-2&partnerID=40&md5=7991afa561912376badc656d08226e18
