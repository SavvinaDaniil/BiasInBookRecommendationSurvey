[Method/Process] 39 academic papers discussing the ethics of artificial intelligence were collected under the discipline category of library and information in the core collection of Web of Science in the past five years. The content analysis method was used to analyze from the perspectives of problem levels, application fields and solutions. [ Result/Conclusion] The findings indicated that the papers published in library and information science journals studied similar issues as the whole field of artificial ethics. The research perspective covered both humanism and technicism. The research content covered data, algorithm and artificial intelligence system at different levels, involving medical and health, political and military fields. In addition, the research discussed the solutions from the social and technical perspectives. The future research can further focus on the information life cycle, strengthen the diversity of the level and field ol ethical issues, and promote the research ol artificial intelligence ethical norms and guidelines. © 2021 Editorial Board of Journal of Modern Information.
