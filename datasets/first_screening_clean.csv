Scopus,Yes,The Unfairness of Popularity Bias in Book Recommendation,Naghiaei M.; Rahmani H.A.; Dehghan M.,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2022.0,"Recent studies have shown that recommendation systems commonly suffer from popularity bias. Popularity bias refers to the problem that popular items (i.e., frequently rated items) are recommended frequently while less popular items are recommended rarely or not at all. Researchers adopted two approaches to examining popularity bias: (i) from the users’ perspective, by analyzing how far a recommendation system deviates from user’s expectations in receiving popular items, and (ii) by analyzing the amount of exposure that long-tail items receive, measured by overall catalog coverage and novelty. In this paper, we examine the first point of view in the book domain, although the findings may be applied to other domains as well. To this end, we analyze the well-known Book-Crossing dataset and define three user groups based on their tendency towards popular items (i.e., Niche, Diverse, Bestseller-focused). Further, we evaluate the performance of nine state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and two baselines (i.e., Random, MostPop) from both the accuracy (e.g., NDCG, Precision, Recall) and popularity bias perspectives. Our results indicate that most state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in the book domain, and fail to meet users’ expectations with Niche and Diverse tastes despite having a larger profile size. Conversely, Bestseller-focused users are more likely to receive high-quality recommendations, both in terms of fairness and personalization. Furthermore, our study shows a tradeoff between personalization and unfairness of popularity bias in recommendation algorithms for users belonging to the Diverse and Bestseller groups, that is, algorithms with high capability of personalization suffer from the unfairness of popularity bias. Finally, across the models, our results show that WMF and VAECF can provide a higher quality recommendation when considering both accuracy and fairness perspectives. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134358321&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-09316-6_7&partnerID=40&md5=548f25798dbb919d482bf020f932d01b

In response, countless broad principles and guidelines for ethical AI have been published, and following those, specific approaches have been proposed for how to encourage ethical outcomes of AI.

An important part of Knowledge Management is the classification and organisation of knowledge to make it findable and reveal connections in related subjects. Discussion on the ethical aspects of this issue have recently been brought to the fore in both Library and Information Studies (LIS), in terms of objections to Library classification terms, and also in AI which can classify data using data sets which themselves reflect existing injustices and bias. The ethical implications of both types of knowledge classification can be better understood when the classification ethics debate in LIS and AI are used to inform each other. Findings include that AI provides clarity on measuring adverse outcomes whilst LIS provides nuance on the potential cultural and psychological harm of inappropriate terminology and inaccurate positioning within ‘worlds of knowledge’. © 2022, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Public library storytime programs serve as venues to showcase books with characters of varied backgrounds, identities, and experiences who may or may not reflect those of the communities the libraries serve. Because storytime providers often rely on online resources to plan their programs, it is important to investigate the presence and quality of EDI elements in books recommended for storytimes by these resources. The present study analyzed the text, illustrations, and WorldCat metadata for a random sample of 481 children's books recommended by six popular online resources for storytime planning.

To tackle this issue, this study introduces a novel hybrid model that combines graph convolutional networks (GCN) based on bipartite graphs and neural matrix factorization (NMF). This model aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of children’s book recommendations by accurately capturing user biases. In this model, the complex interactions between users and books are modeled as a bipartite graph, with the users’ book ratings serving as the weights of the edges. Through GCN and NMF, we can delve into the structure of the graph and the behavioral patterns of users, more accurately identify and address user biases, and predict their future behaviors. Compared to traditional recommendation systems, our hybrid model excels in handling large-scale user review data. Experimental results confirm that our model has significantly improved in terms of recommendation accuracy and scalability, positively contributing to the advancement of children’s book recommendation systems. © 2024 Shen and Jian",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190275288&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj-cs.1858&partnerID=40&md5=5d0f6d16bef32eae8f732485e1e4b578

AI policies and regulations are now emerging at the same time as more is learned about the implications of bias in machine learning sets, the surveillance risks of smart cities and facial recognition, and automated decision-making by government, among many other applications of AI and machine learning. Each of these issues raises concerns around ethics, privacy, and data protection. This paper introduces some of the key AI regulatory developments to date and engagement by libraries in these processes. While many AI applications are largely emergent and hypothetical in libraries, some mature examples can be identified in research literature searching, language tools for textual analysis, and access to collection data. The paper presents a summary of how library activities such as these are represented in national AI plans and ways that libraries have engaged with other aspects of AI regulation including the development of ethical frameworks.

Scopus,Yes,Exploring author gender in book rating and recommendation,Ekstrand M.D.; Kluver D.,User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction,2021.0,"Collaborative filtering algorithms find useful patterns in rating and consumption data and exploit these patterns to guide users to good items. Many of these patterns reflect important real-world phenomena driving interactions between the various users and items; other patterns may be irrelevant or reflect undesired discrimination, such as discrimination in publishing or purchasing against authors who are women or ethnic minorities. In this work, we examine the response of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms to the distribution of their input data with respect to one dimension of social concern, namely content creator gender. Using publicly available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data. We find that common collaborative filtering algorithms tend to propagate at least some of each user’s tendency to rate or read male or female authors into their resulting recommendations, although they differ in both the strength of this propagation and the variance in the gender balance of the recommendation lists they produce. The data, experimental design, and statistical methods are designed to be reusable for studying potentially discriminatory social dimensions of recommendations in other domains and settings as well. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100480096&doi=10.1007%2fs11257-020-09284-2&partnerID=40&md5=7991afa561912376badc656d08226e18
